            "   IT was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.\n",
            "   Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame.\n",
            "   He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered.\n",
            "   He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.\n",
            "   He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.\n",
            "   Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.\n",
            "   The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment before his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a persons standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.\n",
            "   But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper. Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there, waiting?\n",
            "   He turned the corner.\n",
            "   The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting.\n",
            "   The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive, that he felt he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenix-disc on his chest, he spoke again.\n",
            "   “Of course,” he said, “youre a new neighbour, arent you?”\n",
            "   “And you must be”—she raised her eyes from his professional symbols—“the fireman.” Her voice trailed off.\n",
            "   “How oddly you say that.”\n",
            "   “Id-Id have known it with my eyes shut,” she said, slowly.\n",
            "   “What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains,” he laughed. “You never wash it off completely.”\n",
            "   “No, you dont,” she said, in awe.\n",
            "   He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once moving herself.\n",
            "   “Kerosene,” he said, because the silence had lengthened, “is nothing but perfume to me.”\n",
            "   “Does it seem like that, really?”\n",
            "   “Of course. Why not?”\n",
            "   She gave herself time to think of it. “I dont know.” She turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes. “Do you mind if I walk back with you? Im Clarisse McClellan.”\n",
            "   “Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?”\n",
            "   They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the year.\n",
            "   There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.\n",
            "   “Well,” she said, “Im seventeen and Im crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isnt this a nice time of night to walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night, walking, and watch the sun rise.”\n",
            "   They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, “You know, Im not afraid of you at all.”\n",
            "   He was surprised. “Why should you be?”\n",
            "   “So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But youre just a man, after all...”\n",
            "   He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon...\n",
            "   And then Clarisse McClellan said:\n",
            "   “Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked at being a fireman?”\n",
            "   “Since I was twenty, ten years ago.”\n",
            "   “Do you ever read any of the books you bum?”\n",
            "   He laughed. “Thats against the law!”\n",
            "   “Oh. Of course.”\n",
            "   “Its fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn ‘em to ashes, then bum the ashes. Thats our official slogan.”\n",
            "   They walked still further and the girl said, “Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?”\n",
            "   “No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it.”\n",
            "   “Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.”\n",
            "   He laughed.\n",
            "   She glanced quickly over. “Why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” He started to laugh again and stopped “Why?”\n",
            "   “You laugh when I havent been funny and you answer right off. You never stop to think what Ive asked you.”\n",
            "   He stopped walking, “You are an odd one,” he said, looking at her. “Havent you any respect?”\n",
            "   “I dont mean to be insulting. Its just, I love to watch people too much, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Well, doesnt this mean anything to you?” He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-coloured sleeve.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she whispered. She increased her pace. “Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?\n",
            "   “Youre changing the subject!”\n",
            "   “I sometimes think drivers dont know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,” she said. “If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! hed say, thats grass! A pink blur? Thats a rose-garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isnt that funny, and sad, too?”\n",
            "   “You think too many things,” said Montag, uneasily.\n",
            "   “I rarely watch the ‘parlour walls’ or go to races or Fun Parks. So Ive lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.”\n",
            "   “I didnt know that!” Montag laughed abruptly.\n",
            "   “Bet I know something else you dont. Theres dew on the grass in the morning.”\n",
            "   He suddenly couldnt remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite irritable.\n",
            "   “And if you look”—she nodded at the sky—“theres a man in the moon.”\n",
            "   He hadnt looked for a long time.\n",
            "   They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were blazing.\n",
            "   “Whats going on?” Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.\n",
            "   “Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Its like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another time-did I tell you?-for being a pedestrian. Oh, were most peculiar.”\n",
            "   “But what do you talk about?”\n",
            "   She laughed at this. “Good night!” She started up her walk. Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. “Are you happy?” she said.\n",
            "   “Am I what?” he cried.\n",
            "   But she was gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently.\n",
            "   “Happy! Of all the nonsense.”\n",
            "   He stopped laughing.\n",
            "   He put his hand into the glove-hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door slid open.\n",
            "   Of course Im happy. What does she think? Im not? he asked the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes quickly away.\n",
            "   What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked...\n",
            "   Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girls face was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but moving also toward a new sun.\n",
            "   “What?” asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience.\n",
            "   He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your own light to you? People were more often-he searched for a simile, found one in his work-torches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other peoples faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?\n",
            "   What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes? Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would.\n",
            "   Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night...\n",
            "   He opened the bedroom door.\n",
            "   It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not empty.\n",
            "   He listened.\n",
            "   The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.\n",
            "   He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\n",
            "   Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.\n",
            "   The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the curtains and open the french windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air,. he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed.\n",
            "   An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.\n",
            "   He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night. The breath coming out of the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fibre of hair.\n",
            "   He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick...\n",
            "   Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall; but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out of her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.\n",
            "   The object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under the edge of his own bed. The small crystal bottle of sleeping-tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare.\n",
            "   As he stood there the sky over the house screamed. There was a tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand miles of black linen down the seam. Montag was cut in half. He felt his chest chopped down and split apart. The jet-bombs going over, going over, going over, one two, one two, one two, six of them, nine of them, twelve of them, one and one and one and another and another and another, did all the screaming for him. He opened his own mouth and let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth. The house shook. The flare went out in his hand. The moonstones vanished. He felt his hand plunge toward the telephone.\n",
            "   The jets were gone. He felt his lips move, brushing the mouthpiece of the phone. “Emergency hospital.” A terrible whisper.\n",
            "   He felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be thought as he stood shivering in the dark, and let his lips go on moving and moving.\n",
            "   They had this machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil. Did it drink of the darkness? Did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the years? It fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation and blind searching. It had an Eye. The impersonal operator of the machine could, by wearing a special optical helmet, gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out. What did the Eye see? He did not say. He saw but did not see what the Eye saw. The entire operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in ones yard. The woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they had reached. Go on, anyway, shove the bore down, slush up the emptiness, if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the suction snake. The operator stood smoking a cigarette. The other machine was working too.\n",
            "   The other machine was operated by an equally impersonal fellow in non-stainable reddish-brown overalls. This machine pumped all of the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum.\n",
            "   “Got to clean ‘em out both ways,” said the operator, standing over the silent woman. “No use getting the stomach if you dont clean the blood. Leave that stuff in the blood and the blood hits the brain like a mallet, bang, a couple of thousand times and the brain just gives up, just quits.”\n",
            "   “Stop it!” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I was just sayin,” said the operator.\n",
            "   “Are you done?” said Montag.\n",
            "   They shut the machines up tight. “Were done.” His anger did not even touch them. They stood with the cigarette smoke curling around their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint. “Thats fifty bucks.”\n",
            "   “First, why dont you tell me if shell be all right?”\n",
            "   “Sure, shell be O. K. We got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase here, it cant get at her now. As I said, you take out the old and put in the new and youre O. K.”\n",
            "   “Neither of you is an M. D. Why didnt they send an M. D. from Emergency?”\n",
            "   “Hell!” the operators cigarette moved on his lips. “We get these cases nine or ten a night. Got so many, starting a few years ago, we had the special machines built. With the optical lens, of course, that was new; the rest is ancient. You dont need an M. D., case like this; all you need is two handymen, clean up the problem in half an hour. Look”—he started for the door—“we gotta go. Just had another call on the old ear-thimble. Ten blocks from here. Someone else just jumped off the cap of a pillbox. Call if you need us again. Keep her quiet. We got a contra-sedative in her. Shell wake up hungry. So long.”\n",
            "   And the men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths, the men with the eyes of puff-adders, took up their load of machine and tube, their case of liquid melancholy and the slow dark sludge of nameless stuff, and strolled out the door.\n",
            "   Montag sank down into a chair and looked at this woman. Her eyes were closed now, gently, and he put out his hand to feel the warmness of breath on his palm.\n",
            "   “Mildred,” he said, at last.\n",
            "   There are too many of us, he thought. There are billions of us and thats too many. Nobody knows anyone. Strangers come and violate you. Strangers come and cut your heart out. Strangers come and take your blood. Good God, who were those men? I never saw them before in my life!\n",
            "   Half an hour passed.\n",
            "   The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of colour and they looked soft and relaxed. Someone elses blood there. If only someone elses flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaners and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning. If only...\n",
            "   He got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows wide to let the night air in. It was two oclock in the morning. Was it only an hour ago, Clarisse McClellan in the street, and him coming in, and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle? Only an hour, but the world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colourless form.\n",
            "   Laughter blew across the moon-coloured lawn from the house of Clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly. Above all, their laughter was relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in darkness. Montag heard the voices talking, talking, talking, giving, talking, weaving, reweaving their hypnotic web.\n",
            "   Montag moved out through the french windows and crossed the lawn, without even thinking of it. He stood outside the talking house in the shadows, thinking he might even tap on their door and whisper, “Let me come in. I wont say anything. I just want to listen. What is it youre saying?”\n",
            "   But instead he stood there, very cold, his face a mask of ice, listening to a mans voice (the uncle?) moving along at an easy pace:\n",
            "   “Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow, wad, flush. Everyone using everyone elses coattails. How are you supposed to root for the home team when you dont even have a programme or know the names? For that matter, what colour jerseys are they wearing as they trot out on to the field?”\n",
            "   Montag moved back to his own house, left the window wide, checked Mildred, tucked the covers about her carefully, and then lay down with the moonlight on his cheek-bones and on the frowning ridges in his brow, with the moonlight distilled in each eye to form a silver cataract there.\n",
            "   One drop of rain. Clarisse. Another drop. Mildred. A third. The uncle. A fourth. The fire tonight. One, Clarisse. Two, Mildred. Three, uncle. Four, fire, One, Mildred, two, Clarisse. One, two, three, four, five, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, sleeping-tablets, men, disposable tissue, coat-tails, blow, wad, flush, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, tablets, tissues, blow, wad, flush. One, two, three, one, two, three! Rain. The storm. The uncle laughing. Thunder falling downstairs. The whole world pouring down. The fire gushing up in a volcano. All rushing on down around in a spouting roar and rivering stream toward morning.\n",
            "   “I dont know anything any more,” he said, and let a sleep-lozenge dissolve on his tongue.\n",
            "   At nine in the morning, Mildreds bed was empty.\n",
            "   Montag got up quickly, his heart pumping, and ran down the hall and stopped at the kitchen door.\n",
            "   Toast popped out of the silver toaster, was seized by a spidery metal hand that drenched it with melted butter.\n",
            "   Mildred watched the toast delivered to her plate. She had both ears plugged with electronic bees that were humming the hour away. She looked up suddenly, saw him, and nodded.\n",
            "   “You all right?” he asked.\n",
            "   She was an expert at lip-reading from ten years of apprenticeship at Seashell ear-thimbles. She nodded again. She set the toaster clicking away at another piece of bread.\n",
            "   Montag sat down.\n",
            "   His wife said, “I dont know why I should be so hungry.”\n",
            "   “You-?”\n",
            "   “Im HUNGRY.”\n",
            "   “Last night,” he began.\n",
            "   “Didnt sleep well. Feel terrible,” she said. “God, Im hungry. I cant figure it.”\n",
            "   “Last night-” he said again.\n",
            "   She watched his lips casually. “What about last night?”\n",
            "   “Dont you remember?”\n",
            "   “What? Did we have a wild party or something? Feel like Ive a hangover. God, Im hungry. Who was here?”\n",
            "   “A few people,” he said.\n",
            "   “Thats what I thought.” She chewed her toast. “Sore stomach, but Im hungry as all-get-out. Hope I didnt do anything foolish at the party.”\n",
            "   “No,” he said, quietly.\n",
            "   The toaster spidered out a piece of buttered bread for him. He held it in his hand, feeling grateful.\n",
            "   “You dont look so hot yourself,” said his wife.\n",
            "   In the late afternoon it rained and the entire world was dark grey. He stood in the hall of his house, putting on his badge with the orange salamander burning across it. He stood looking up at the air-conditioning vent in the hall for a long time. His wife in the TV parlour paused long enough from reading her script to glance up. “Hey,” she said. “The mans THINKING!”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “I wanted to talk to you.” He paused. “You took all the pills in your bottle last night.”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wouldnt do that,” she said, surprised.\n",
            "   “The bottle was empty.”\n",
            "   “I wouldnt do a thing like that. Why would I do a thing like that?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Maybe you took two pills and forgot and took two more, and forgot again and took two more, and were so dopy you kept right on until you had thirty or forty of them in you.”\n",
            "   “Heck,” she said, “what would I want to go and do a silly thing like that for?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” he said.\n",
            "   She was quite obviously waiting for him to go. “I didnt do that,” she said. “Never in a billion years.”\n",
            "   “All right if you say so,” he said.\n",
            "   “Thats what the lady said.” She turned back to her script.\n",
            "   “Whats on this afternoon?” he asked tiredly.\n",
            "   She didnt look up from her script again. “Well, this is a play comes on the wall-to-wall circuit in ten minutes. They mailed me my part this morning. I sent in some box-tops. They write the script with one part missing. Its a new idea. The home-maker, thats me, is the missing part. When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, ‘What do you think of this whole idea, Helen?’ And he looks at me sitting here centre stage, see? And I say, I say—” She paused and ran her finger under a line in the script. ‘I think thats fine!’ And then they go on with the play until he says, ‘Do you agree to that, Helen!’ and I say, ‘I sure do!’ Isnt that fun, Guy?”\n",
            "   He stood in the hall looking at her.\n",
            "   “Its sure fun,” she said.\n",
            "   “Whats the play about?”\n",
            "   “I just told you. There are these people named Bob and Ruth and Helen.”\n",
            "   “Oh.”\n",
            "   “Its really fun. Itll be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? Its only two thousand dollars.”\n",
            "   “Thats one-third of my yearly pay.”\n",
            "   “Its only two thousand dollars,” she replied. “And I should think youd consider me sometimes. If we had a fourth wall, why itd be just like this room wasnt ours at all, but all kinds of exotic peoples rooms. We could do without a few things.”\n",
            "   “Were already doing without a few things to pay for the third wall. It was put in only two months ago, remember?”\n",
            "   “Is that all it was?” She sat looking at him for a long moment. “Well, good-bye, dear.”\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” he said. He stopped and turned around. “Does it have a happy ending?”\n",
            "   “I havent read that far.”\n",
            "   He walked over, read the last page, nodded, folded the script, and handed it back to her. He walked out of the house into the rain.\n",
            "   The rain was thinning away and the girl was walking in the centre of the sidewalk with her head up and the few drops falling on her face. She smiled when she saw Montag.\n",
            "   “Hello!”\n",
            "   He said hello and then said, “What are you up to now?”\n",
            "   “Im still crazy. The rain feels good. I love to walk in it.\n",
            "   “I dont think Id like that,” he said.\n",

            "   “I never have.”\n",
            "   She licked her lips. “Rain even tastes good.”\n",
            "   “What do you do, go around trying everything once?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Sometimes twice.” She looked at something in her hand.\n",
            "   “Whatve you got there?” he said.\n",
            "   “I guess its the last of the dandelions this year. I didnt think Id find one on the lawn this late. Have you ever heard of rubbing it under your chin? Look.” She touched her chin with the flower, laughing.\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “If it rubs off, it means Im in love. Has it?”\n",
            "   He could hardly do anything else but look.\n",
            "   “Well?” she said.\n",
            "   “Youre yellow under there.”\n",
            "   “Fine! Lets try YOU now.”\n",
            "   “It wont work for me.”\n",
            "   “Here.” Before he could move she had put the dandelion under his chin. He drew back and she laughed. “Hold still!”\n",
            "   She peered under his chin and frowned.\n",
            "   “Well?” he said.\n",
            "   “What a shame,” she said. “Youre not in love with anyone.”\n",
            "   “Yes, I am!”\n",
            "   “It doesnt show.”\n",
            "   “I am very much in love!” He tried to conjure up a face to fit the words, but there was no face. “I am!”\n",
            "   “Oh please dont look that way.”\n",
            "   “Its that dandelion,” he said. “Youve used it all up on yourself. Thats why it wont work for me.”\n",
            "   “Of course, that must be it. Oh, now Ive upset you, I can see I have; Im sorry, really I am.” She touched his elbow.\n",
            "   “No, no,” he said, quickly, “Im all right.”\n",
            "   “Ive got to be going, so say you forgive me. I dont want you angry with me.”\n",
            "   “Im not angry. Upset, yes.”\n",
            "   “Ive got to go to see my psychiatrist now. They make me go. I made up things to say. I dont know what he thinks of me. He says Im a regular onion! I keep him busy peeling away the layers.”\n",
            "   “Im inclined to believe you need the psychiatrist,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “You dont mean that.”\n",
            "   He took a breath and let it out and at last said, “No, I dont mean that.”\n",
            "   “The psychiatrist wants to know why I go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies. Ill show you my collection some day.”\n",
            "   “Good.”\n",
            "   “They want to know what I do with all my time. I tell them that sometimes I just sit and think. But I wont tell them what. Ive got them running. And sometimes, I tell them, I like to put my head back, like this, and let the rain fall into my mouth. It tastes just like wine. Have you ever tried it?”\n",
            "   “No I—”\n",
            "   “You HAVE forgiven me, havent you?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” He thought about it. “Yes, I have. God knows why. Youre peculiar, youre aggravating, yet youre easy to forgive. You say youre seventeen?”\n",
            "   “Well-next month.”\n",
            "   “How odd. How strange. And my wife thirty and yet you seem so much older at times. I cant get over it.”\n",
            "   “Youre peculiar yourself, Mr. Montag. Sometimes I even forget youre a fireman. Now, may I make you angry again?”\n",
            "   “Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “How did it start? How did you get into it? How did you pick your work and how did you happen to think to take the job you have? Youre not like the others. Ive seen a few; I know. When I talk, you look at me. When I said something about the moon, you looked at the moon, last night. The others would never do that. The others would walk off and leave me talking. Or threaten me. No one has time any more for anyone else. Youre one of the few who put up with me. Thats why I think its so strange youre a fireman, it just doesnt seem right for you, somehow.”\n",
            "   He felt his body divide itself into a hotness and a coldness, a softness and a hardness, a trembling and a not trembling, the two halves grinding one upon the other.\n",
            "   “Youd better run on to your appointment,” he said.\n",
            "   And she ran off and left him standing there in the rain. Only after a long time did he move.\n",
            "   And then, very slowly, as he walked, he tilted his head back in the rain, for just a few moments, and opened his mouth...\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live in its gently humming, gently vibrating, softly illuminated kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse. The dim light of one in the morning, the moonlight from the open sky framed through the great window, touched here and there on the brass and the copper and the steel of the faintly trembling beast. Light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently, gently, gently, its eight legs spidered under it on rubber-padded paws.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the brass pole. He went out to look at the city and the clouds had cleared away completely, and he lit a cigarette and came back to bend down and look at the Hound. It was like a great bee come home from some field where the honey is full of poison wildness, of insanity and nightmare, its body crammed with that over-rich nectar and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself.\n",
            "   “Hello,” whispered Montag, fascinated as always with the dead beast, the living beast.\n",
            "   At night when things got dull, which was every night, the men slid down the brass poles, and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory system of the Hound and let loose rats in the firehouse area-way, and sometimes chickens, and sometimes cats that would have to be drowned anyway, and there would be betting to see which the Hound would seize first. The animals were turned loose. Three seconds later the game was done, the rat, cat, or chicken caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentling paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the Hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine. The pawn was then tossed in the incinerator. A new game began.\n",
            "   Montag stayed upstairs most nights when this went on. There had been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them, and lost a weeks salary and faced Mildreds insane anger, which showed itself in veins and blotches. But now at night he lay in his bunk, face turned to the wall, listening to whoops of laughter below and the piano-string scurry of rat feet, the violin squeaking of mice, and the great shadowing, motioned silence of the Hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light, finding, holding its victim, inserting the needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a switch had been turned.\n",
            "   Montag touched the muzzle..\n",
            "   The Hound growled.\n",
            "   Montag jumped back.\n",
            "   The Hound half rose in its kennel and looked at him with green-blue neon light flickering in its suddenly activated eyebulbs. It growled again, a strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle, a frying sound, a scraping of metal, a turning of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion.\n",
            "   “No, no, boy,” said Montag, his heart pounding.\n",
            "   He saw the silver needle extended upon the air an inch, pull back, extend, pull back. The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him.\n",
            "   Montag backed up. The Hound took a step from its kennel.\n",
            "   Montag grabbed the brass pole with one hand. The pole, reacting, slid upward, and took him through the ceiling, quietly. He stepped off in the half-lit deck of the upper level. He was trembling and his face was green-white. Below, the Hound had sunk back down upon its eight incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again, its multi-faceted eyes at peace.\n",
            "   Montag stood, letting the fears pass, by the drop-hole. Behind him, four men at a card table under a green-lidded light in the corner glanced briefly but said nothing. Only the man with the Captains hat and the sign of the Phoenix on his hat, at last, curious, his playing cards in his thin hand, talked across the long room.\n",
            "   “Montag...?”\n",
            "   “It doesnt like me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What, the Hound?” The Captain studied his cards.\n",
            "   “Come off it. It doesnt like or dislike. It just ‘functions.’ Its like a lesson in ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide for it. It follows through. It targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. Its only copper wire, storage batteries, and electricity.”\n",
            "   Montag swallowed. “Its calculators can be set to any combination, so many amino acids, so much sulphur, so much butterfat and alkaline. Right?”\n",
            "   “We all know that.”\n",
            "   “All of those chemical balances and percentages on all of us here in the house are recorded in the master file downstairs. It would be easy for someone to set up a partial combination on the Hounds ‘memory,’ a touch of amino acids, perhaps. That would account for what the animal did just now. Reacted toward me.”\n",
            "   “Hell,” said the Captain.\n",
            "   “Irritated, but not completely angry. Just enough ‘memory’ set up in it by someone so it growled when I touched it.”\n",
            "   “Who would do a thing like that?.” asked the Captain. “You havent any enemies here, Guy.”\n",
            "   “None that I know of.”\n",
            "   “Well have the Hound checked by our technicians tomorrow.\n",
            "   “This isnt the first time its threatened me,” said Montag. “Last month it happened twice.”\n",
            "   “Well fix it up. Dont worry”\n",
            "   But Montag did not move and only stood thinking of the ventilator grille in the hall at home and what lay hidden behind the grille. If someone here in the firehouse knew about the ventilator then mightnt they “tell” the Hound...?\n",
            "   The Captain came over to the drop-hole and gave Montag a questioning glance.\n",
            "   “I was just figuring,” said Montag, “what does the Hound think about down there nights? Is it coming alive on us, really? It makes me cold.”\n",
            "   “It doesnt think anything we dont want it to think.”\n",
            "   “Thats sad,” said Montag, quietly, “because all we put into it is hunting and finding and killing. What a shame if thats all it can ever know.”\n",
            "   Beatty snorted, gently. “Hell! Its a fine bit of craftsmanship, a good rifle that can fetch its own target and guarantees the bulls-eye every time.”\n",
            "   “Thats why,” said Montag. “I wouldnt want to be its next victim.\n",
            "   “Why? You got a guilty conscience about something?”\n",
            "   Montag glanced up swiftly.\n",
            "   Beatty stood there looking at him steadily with his eyes, while his mouth opened and began to laugh, very softly.\n",
            "   One two three four five six seven days. And as many times he came out of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumb-tacked to his door. Every day Clarisse walked him to the corner. One day it was raining, the next it was clear, the day after that the wind blew strong, and the day after that it was mild and calm, and the day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer and Clarisse with her face all sunburnt by late afternoon.\n",
            "   “Why is it,” he said, one time, at the subway entrance, “I feel Ive known you so many years?”\n",
            "   “Because I like you,” she said, “and I dont want anything from you. And because we know each other.”\n",
            "   “You make me feel very old and very much like a father.”\n",
            "   “Now you explain,” she said, “why you havent any daughters like me, if you love children so much?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Youre joking!”\n",
            "   “I mean-” He stopped and shook his head. “Well, my wife, she... she just never wanted any children at all.”\n",
            "   The girl stopped smiling. “Im sorry. I really, thought you were having fun at my expense. Im a fool.”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he said. “It was a good question. Its been a long time since anyone cared enough to ask. A good question.”\n",
            "   “Lets talk about something else. Have you ever smelled old leaves? Dont they smell like cinnamon? Here. Smell.”\n",
            "   “Why, yes, it is like cinnamon in a way.”\n",
            "   She looked at him with her clear dark eyes. “You always seem shocked.”\n",

            "   “Does it?”\n",
            "   “Much more relaxed.”\n",
            "   He felt at ease and comfortable. “Why arent you in school? I see you every day wandering around.”\n",
            "   “Oh, they dont miss me,” she said. “Im anti-social, they say. I dont mix. Its so strange. Im very social indeed. It all depends on what you mean by social, doesnt it? Social to me means talking about things like this.” She rattled some chestnuts that had fallen off the tree in the front yard. “Or talking about how strange the world is. Being with people is nice. But I dont think its social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most dont; they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film-teacher. Thats not social to me at all. Its a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and them telling us its wine when its not. They run us so ragged by the end of the day we cant do anything but go to bed or head for a Fun Park to bully people around, break windowpanes in the Window Smasher place or wreck cars in the Car Wrecker place with the big steel ball. Or go out in the cars and race on the streets, trying to see how close you can get to lamp-posts, playing ‘chicken’ and ‘knock hub-caps.’ I guess Im everything they say I am, all right. I havent any friends. Thats supposed to prove Im abnormal. But everyone I know is either shouting or dancing around like wild or beating up one another. Do you notice how people hurt each other nowadays?”\n",
            "   “You sound so very old.”\n",
            "   “Sometimes Im ancient. Im afraid of children my own age. They kill each other. Did it always used to be that way? My uncle says no. Six of my friends have been shot in the last year alone. Ten of them died in car wrecks. Im afraid of them and they dont like me because Im afraid. My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children didnt kill each other. But that was a long time ago when they had things different. They believed in responsibility, my uncle says. Do you know, Im responsible. I was spanked when I needed it, years ago. And I do all the shopping and house-cleaning by hand.\n",
            "   “But most of all,” she said, “I like to watch people. Sometimes I ride the subway all day and look at them and listen to them. I just want to figure out who they are and what they want and where theyre going. Sometimes I even go to the Fun Parks and ride in the jet cars when they race on the edge of town at midnight and the police dont care as long as theyre insured. As long as everyone has ten thousand insurance everyones happy. Sometimes I sneak around and listen in subways. Or I listen at soda fountains, and do you know what?”\n",

And at the museums, have you ever been? All abstract. Thats all there is now. My uncle says it was different once. A long time back sometimes pictures said things or even showed people.”\n",

            "   And then, Clarisse was gone. He didnt know what there was about the afternoon, but it was not seeing her somewhere in the world. The lawn was empty, the trees empty, the street empty, and while at first he did not even know he missed her or was even looking for her, the fact was that by the time he reached the subway, there were vague stirrings of un-ease in him. Something was the matter, his routine had been disturbed. A simple routine, true, established in a short few days, and yet...? He almost turned back to make the walk again, to give her time to appear. He was certain if he tried the same route, everything would work out fine. But it was late, and the arrival of his train put a stop to his plan.\n",
            "   The flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time-voice in the firehouse ceiling “...one thirty-five. Thursday morning, November 4th,... one thirty-six... one thirty-seven a. m...” The tick of the playing-cards on the greasy table-top, all the sounds came to Montag, behind his closed eyes, behind the barrier he had momentarily erected. He could feel the firehouse full of glitter and shine and silence, of brass colours, the colours of coins, of gold, of silver: The unseen men across the table were sighing on their cards, waiting.\n",
            "   “...one forty-five...” The voice-clock mourned out the cold hour of a cold morning of a still colder year.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong, Montag?”\n",

            "   The firehouse trembled as a great flight of jet planes whistled a single note across the black morning sky.\n",
            "   Montag blinked. Beatty was looking at him as if he were a museum statue. At any moment, Beatty might rise and walk about him, touching, exploring his guilt and self-consciousness. Guilt? What guilt was that?\n",
            "   “Your play, Montag.”\n",
            "   Montag looked at these men whose faces were sunburnt by a thousand real and ten thousand imaginary fires, whose work flushed their cheeks and fevered their eyes. These men who looked steadily into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning black pipes. They and their charcoal hair and soot-coloured brows and bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had shaven close; but their heritage showed. Montag started up, his mouth opened. Had he ever seen a fireman that didnt have black hair, black brows, a fiery face, and a blue-steel shaved but unshaved look? These men were all mirror-images of himself! Were all firemen picked then for their looks as well as their proclivities? The colour of cinders and ash about them, and the continual smell of burning from their pipes. Captain Beatty there, rising in thunderheads of tobacco smoke. Beatty opening a fresh tobacco packet, crumpling the cellophane into a sound of fire.\n",
            "   Montag looked at the cards in his own hands. “I-Ive been thinking. About the fire last week. About the man whose library we fixed. What happened to him?”\n",

            "   “He. wasnt insane.”\n",
            "   Beatty arranged his cards quietly. “Any mans insane who thinks he can fool the Government and us.”\n",
            "   “Ive tried to imagine,” said Montag, “just how it would feel. I mean to have firemen burn our houses and our books.”\n",
            "   “We havent any books.”\n",
            "   “But if we did have some.”\n",
            "   “You got some?”\n",
            "   Beatty blinked slowly.\n",
            "   “No.” Montag gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists of a million forbidden books. Their names leapt in fire, burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene. “No.” But in his mind, a cool wind started up and blew out of the ventilator grille at home, softly, softly, chilling his face. And, again, he saw himself in a green park talking to an old man, a very old man, and the wind from the park was cold, too.\n",
            "   Montag hesitated, “Was-was it always like this? The firehouse, our work? I mean, well, once upon a time...”\n",
            "   “Once upon a time!” Beatty said. “What kind of talk is THAT?”\n",
            "   Fool, thought Montag to himself, youll give it away. At the last fire, a book of fairy tales, hed glanced at a single line. “I mean,” he said, “in the old days, before homes were completely fireproofed” Suddenly it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him. He opened his mouth and it was Clarisse McClellan saying, “Didnt firemen prevent fires rather than stoke them up and get them going?”\n",
            "   “Thats rich!” Stoneman and Black drew forth their rulebooks, which also contained brief histories of the Firemen of America, and laid them out where Montag, though long familiar with them, might read:\n",
            "   “Established, 1790, to burn English-influenced books in the Colonies. First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin.”\n",
            "   RULE 1. Answer the alarm swiftly.\n",
            "   2. Start the fire swiftly.\n",
            "   3. Burn everything.\n",
            "   4. Report back to firehouse immediately.\n",
            "   5. Stand alert for other alarms.\n",
            "   Everyone watched Montag. He did not move.\n",
            "   The alarm sounded.\n",
            "   The bell in the ceiling kicked itself two hundred times. Suddenly there were four empty chairs. The cards fell in a flurry of snow. The brass pole shivered. The men were gone.\n",
            "   Montag sat in his chair. Below, the orange dragon coughed into life.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the pole like a man in a dream.\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound leapt up in its kennel, its eyes all green flame.\n",
            "   “Montag, you forgot your helmet!”\n",
            "   He seized it off the wall behind him, ran, leapt, and they were off, the night wind hammering about their siren scream and their mighty metal thunder!\n",
            "   It was a flaking three-storey house in the ancient part of the city, a century old if it was a day, but like all houses it had been given a thin fireproof plastic sheath many years ago, and this preservative shell seemed to be the only thing holding it in the sky.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The engine slammed to a stop. Beatty, Stoneman, and Black ran up the sidewalk, suddenly odious and fat in the plump fireproof slickers. Montag followed.\n",
            "   They crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman, though she was not running, she was not trying to escape. She was only standing, weaving from side to side, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head. Her tongue was moving in her mouth, and her eyes seemed to be trying to remember something, and then they remembered and her tongue moved again:\n",
            "   “ ‘Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.’”\n",
            "   “Enough of that!” said Beatty. “Where are they?”\n",
            "   He slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the question. The old womans eyes came to a focus upon Beatty. “You know where they are or you wouldnt be here,” she said.\n",
            "   Stoneman held out the telephone alarm card with the complaint signed in telephone duplicate on the back\n",
            "   “Have reason to suspect attic; 11 No. Elm, City.—E. B.”\n",
            "   “That would be Mrs. Blake, my neighbour;” said the woman, reading the initials.\n",
            "   “All right, men, lets get ‘em!”\n",
            "   Next thing they were up in musty blackness, swinging silver hatchets at doors that were, after all, unlocked, tumbling through like boys all rollick and shout. “Hey!” A fountain of books sprang down upon Montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stair-well. How inconvenient! Always before it had been like snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victims mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You werent hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldnt be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things dont scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene! Whos got a match!\n",
            "   But now, tonight, someone had slipped. This woman was spoiling the ritual. The men were making too much noise, laughing, joking to cover her terrible accusing silence below. She made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor correct. Montag felt an immense irritation. She shouldnt be here, on top of everything!\n",
            "   Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face A book alighted, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim, wavering light, a page hung. open and it was like a snowy feather, the words delicately painted thereon. In all the rush and fervour, Montag had only an instant to read a line, but it blazed in his mind for the next minute as if stamped there with fiery steel. “Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.” He dropped the book. Immediately, another fell into his arms.\n",
            "   “Montag, up here!”\n",
            "   Montags hand closed like a mouth, crushed the book with wild devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air. They fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among the bodies.\n",
            "   Montag had done nothing. His hand had done it all, his hand, with a brain of its own, with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling finger, had turned thief.. Now, it plunged the book back under his arm, pressed it tight to sweating armpit, rushed out empty, with a magicians flourish! Look here! Innocent! Look!\n",
            "   He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were far-sighted. He held it close, as if he were blind.\n",
            "   “Montag!”\n",
            "   He jerked about.\n",
            "   “Dont stand there, idiot!”\n",
            "   The books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone.\n",
            "   “Kerosene! They pumped the cold fluid from the numbered 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book, they pumped rooms full of it.\n",
            "   They hurried downstairs, Montag staggered after them in the kerosene fumes.\n",
            "   “Come on, woman!”\n",
            "   The woman knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag.\n",
            "   “You cant ever have my books,” she said.\n",
            "   “You know the law,” said Beatty. “Wheres your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. Youve been locked up here for years with a regular damned Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now!”\n",
            "   She shook her head.\n",
            "   “The whole house is going up;” said Beatty,\n",
            "   The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at Montag, who stood near the woman.\n",
            "   “Youre not leaving her here?” he protested.\n",
            "   “She wont come.”\n",
            "   “Force her, then!”\n",
            "   Beatty raised his hand in which was concealed the igniter. “Were due back at the house. Besides, these fanatics always try suicide; the patterns familiar.”\n",
            "   Montag placed his hand on the womans elbow. “You can come with me.”\n",
            "   “No,” she said. “Thank you, anyway.”\n",
            "   “Im counting to ten,” said Beatty. “One. Two.”\n",
            "   “Please,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said the woman.\n",
            "   “Three. Four.”\n",
            "   “Here.” Montag pulled at the woman.\n",
            "   The woman replied quietly, “I want to stay here”\n",
            "   “Five. Six.”\n",
            "   “You can stop counting,” she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.\n",
            "   An ordinary kitchen match.\n",
            "   The sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house. Captain Beatty, keeping his dignity, backed slowly through the front door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitements. God, thought Montag, how true! Always at night the alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because the fire is prettier by night? More spectacle, a better show? The pink face of Beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door. The womans hand twitched on the single matchstick. The fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. Montag felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said the woman, and Montag felt himself back away and away out of the door, after Beatty, down the steps, across the lawn, where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail.\n",
            "   On the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly with her eyes, her quietness a condemnation, the woman stood motionless.\n",
            "   Beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene.\n",
            "   He was too late. Montag gasped.\n",
            "   The woman on the porch reached out with contempt for them all, and struck the kitchen match against the railing.\n",
            "   People ran out of houses all down the street.\n",
            "   They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse. Nobody looked at anyone else. Montag sat in the front seat with Beatty and Black. They did not even smoke their pipes. They sat there looking out of the front of the great salamander as they turned a corner and went silently on.\n",
            "   “Master Ridley,” said Montag at last.\n",
            "   “What?” said Beatty.\n",
            "   “She said, ‘Master Ridley.’ She said some crazy thing when we came in the door. ‘Play the man,’ she said, ‘Master Ridley.’ Something, something, something.”\n",
            "   “We shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out,” said Beatty. Stoneman glanced over at the Captain, as did Montag, startled.\n",
            "   Beatty rubbed his chin. “A man named Latimer said that to a man named Nicholas Ridley, as they were being burnt alive at Oxford, for heresy, on October 16, 1555.”\n",
            "   Montag and Stoneman went back to looking at the street as it moved under the engine wheels.\n",
            "   “Im full of bits and pieces,” said Beatty. “Most fire captains have to be. Sometimes I surprise myself. WATCH it, Stoneman!”\n",
            "   Stoneman braked the truck.\n",
            "   “Damn!” said Beatty. “Youve gone right by the comer where we turn for the firehouse.”\n",
            "   “Who is it?”\n",
            "   “Who would it be?” said Montag, leaning back against the closed door in the dark.\n",
            "   His wife said, at last, “Well, put on the light.”\n",
            "   “I dont want the light.”\n",
            "   “Come to bed.”\n",
            "   He heard her roll impatiently; the bedsprings squealed.\n",
            "   “Are you drunk?” she said.\n",
            "   So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders, and then the jump-over from shoulder-blade to shoulder-blade like a spark leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.\n",
            "   His wife said, “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   He balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers.\n",
            "   A minute later she said, “Well, just dont stand there in the middle of the floor.”\n",
            "   He made a small sound.\n",
            "   “What?” she asked.\n",
            "   He made more soft sounds. He stumbled towards the bed and shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow. He fell into bed and his wife cried out, startled. He lay far across the room from her, on a winter island separated by an empty sea. She talked to him for what seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about that and it was only words, like the words he had heard once in a nursery at a friends house, a two-year-old child building word patterns, talking jargon, making pretty sounds in the air. But Montag said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small sounds, he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek. He knew that when she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet.\n",
            "   Late in the night he looked over at Mildred. She was awake. There was a tiny dance of melody in the air, her Seashell was tamped in her ear again and she was listening to far people in far places, her eyes wide and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling.\n",
            "   Wasnt there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and telephoned her to ask what was for dinner? Well, then, why didnt he buy himself an audio-Seashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife late at night, murmur, whisper, shout, scream, yell? But what would he whisper, what would he yell? What could he say?\n",
            "   And suddenly she was so strange he couldnt believe he knew her at all. He was in someone elses house, like those other jokes people told of the gentleman, drunk, coming home late at night, unlocking the wrong door, entering a wrong room, and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work and neither of them the wiser.\n",
            "   “Millie...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “I didnt mean to startle you. What I want to know is...”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet. And where?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet for what?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I mean-originally.”\n",
            "   He knew she must be frowning in the dark.\n",
            "   He clarified it. “The first time we ever met, where was it, and when?”\n",
            "   “Why, it was at—”\n",
            "   She stopped.\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said.\n",
            "   He was cold. “Cant you remember?”\n",
            "   “Its been so long.”\n",
            "   “Only ten years, thats all, only ten!”\n",
            "   “Dont get excited, Im trying to think.” She laughed an odd little laugh that went up and up. “Funny, how funny, not to remember where or when you met your husband or wife.”\n",
            "   He lay massaging his eyes, his brow, and the back of his neck, slowly. He held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure there as if to crush memory into place. It was suddenly more important than any other thing in a life-time that he knew where he had met Mildred.\n",
            "   “It doesnt matter,” She was up in the bathroom now, and he heard the water running, and the swallowing sound she made.\n",
            "   “No, I guess not,” he said.\n",
            "   He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc-oxide-faced men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths and the electronic-eyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water, and he wanted to call out to her, how many have you taken TONIGHT! the capsules! how many will you take later and not know? and so on, every hour! or maybe not tonight, tomorrow night! And me not sleeping, tonight or tomorrow night or any night for a long while; now that this has started. And he thought of her lying on the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her, not bent with concern, but only standing straight, arms folded. And he remembered thinking then that if she died, he was certain he wouldnt cry. For it would be the dying of an unknown, a street face, a newspaper image, and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had begun to cry, not at death but at the thought of not crying at death, a silly empty man near a silly empty woman, while the hungry snake made her still more empty.\n",
            "   How do you get so empty? he wondered. Who takes it out of you? And that awful flower the other day, the dandelion! It had summed up everything, hadnt it? “What a shame! Youre not in love with anyone!” And why not?\n",
            "   Well, wasnt there a wall between him and Mildred, when you came down to it? Literally not just one, wall but, so far, three! And expensive, too! And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls, the gibbering pack of tree-apes that said nothing, nothing, nothing and said it loud, loud, loud. He had taken to calling them relatives from the very first. “Hows Uncle Louis today?” “Who?” “And Aunt Maude?” The most significant memory he had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees (you could feel the memory of their shapes all about) sitting in the centre of the “living-room.” The living-room; what a good job of labelling that was now. No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to Mildred.\n",
            "   “Something must be done!I”\n",
            "   “Yes, something must be done!”\n",
            "   “Well, lets not stand and talk!”\n",
            "   “Lets do it!”\n",
            "   “Im so mad I could SPIT!”\n",
            "   What was it all about? Mildred couldnt say. Who was mad at whom? Mildred didnt quite know. What were they going to do? Well, said Mildred, wait around and see.\n",
            "   He had waited around to see.\n",
            "   A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-never-never-quite-no not quite-touched-bottom...and you fell so fast you didnt touch the sides either...never...quite... touched. anything.\n",
            "   The thunder faded. The music died.\n",
            "   “There,” said Mildred,\n",
            "   And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again:\n",
            "   “Well, everything will be all right now,” said an “aunt.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont be too sure,” said a “cousin.”\n",
            "   “Now, dont get angry!”\n",
            "   “Whos angry?”\n",
            "   “YOU are!”\n",
            "   “Youre mad!”\n",
            "   “Why should I be mad!”\n",
            "   “Because!”\n",
            "   “Thats all very well,” cried Montag, “but what are they mad about? Who are these people? Whos that man and whos that woman? Are they husband and wife, are they divorced, engaged, what? Good God, nothings connected up.”\n",
            "   “They—” said Mildred. “Well, they-they had this fight, you see. They certainly fight a lot. You should listen. I think theyre married. Yes, theyre married. Why?”\n",
            "   And if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the dream complete, then it was the open car and Mildred driving a hundred miles an hour across town, he shouting at her and she shouting back and both trying to hear what was said, but hearing only the scream of the car. “At least keep it down to the minimum!” he yelled: “What?” she cried. “Keep it down to fifty-five, the minimum!” he shouted. “The what?” she shrieked. “Speed!” he shouted. And she pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath from his mouth.\n",
            "   When they stepped out of the car, she had the Seashells stuffed in her ears.\n",
            "   Silence. Onlv the wind blowing softlv.\n",
            "   “Mildred.” He stirred in bed.\n",
            "   He reached over and pulled one of the tiny musical insects out of her ear. “Mildred. Mildred?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” Her voice was faint.\n",
            "   He felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between the slots of the phono-colour walls, speaking, but the speech not piercing the crystal barrier. He could only pantomime, hoping she would turn his way and see him. They could not touch through the glass.\n",
            "   “Mildred, do you know that girl I was telling you about?”\n",
            "   “What girl?” She was almost asleep.\n",
            "   “The girl next door.”\n",
            "   “What girl next door?”\n",
            "   “You know, the high-school girl. Clarisse, her name is.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “I havent seen her for a few days-four days to be exact. Have you seen her?”\n",
            "   “No.”\n",
            "   “Ive meant to talk to you about her. Strange.”\n",
            "   “Oh, I know the one you mean.”\n",
            "   “I thought you would.”\n",
            "   “Her,” said Mildred in the dark room.\n",
            "   “What about her?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “I meant to tell you. Forgot. Forgot.”\n",
            "   “Tell me now. What is it?”\n",
            "   “I think shes gone.”\n",
            "   “Gone?”\n",
            "   “Whole family moved out somewhere. But shes gone for good. I think shes dead.”\n",
            "   “We couldnt be talking about the same girl.”\n",
            "   “No. The same girl. McClellan. McClellan, Run over by a car. Four days ago. Im not sure. But I think shes dead. The family moved out anyway. I dont know. But I think shes dead.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sure of it!”\n",
            "   “No, not sure. Pretty sure.”\n",
            "   “Why didnt you tell me sooner?”\n",
            "   “Forgot.”\n",

            "   “I forgot all about it.”\n",
            "   “Four days ago,” he said, quietly, lying there.\n",
            "   They lay there in the dark room not moving, either of them. “Good night,” she said.\n",
            "   He heard a faint rustle. Her hands moved. The electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow, touched by her hand. Now it was in her ear again, humming.\n",
            "   He listened and his wife was singing under her breath.\n",
            "   Outside the house, a shadow moved, an autumn wind rose up and faded away But there was something else in the silence that he heard. It was like a breath exhaled upon the window. It was like a faint drift of greenish luminescent smoke, the motion of a single huge October leaf blowing across the lawn and away.\n",
            "   The Hound, he thought. Its out there tonight. Its out there now. If I opened the window...\n",
            "   He did not open the window.\n",
            "   He had chills and fever in the morning.\n",
            "   “You cant be sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   He closed his eyes over the hotness. “Yes.”\n",
            "   “But you were all right last night.”\n",
            "   “No, I wasnt all right” He heard the “relatives” shouting in the parlour.\n",
            "   Mildred stood over his bed, curiously. He felt her there, he saw her without opening his eyes, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, her eyes with a kind of cataract unseen but suspect far behind the pupils, the reddened pouting lips, the body as thin as a praying mantis from dieting, and her flesh like white bacon. He could remember her no other way.\n",
            "   “Will you bring me aspirin and water?”\n",
            "   “Youve got to get up,” she said. “Its noon. Youve slept five hours later than usual.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn the parlour off?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Thats my family.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn it off for a sick man?”\n",
            "   “Ill turn it down.”\n",
            "   She went out of the room and did nothing to the parlour and came back. “Is that better?”\n",
            "   “Thanks.”\n",
            "   “Thats my favourite programme,” she said.\n",
            "   “What about the aspirin?”\n",
            "   “Youve never been sick before.” She went away again.\n",
            "   “Well, Im sick now. Im not going to work tonight. Call Beatty for me.”\n",
            "   “You acted funny last night.” She returned, humming.\n",
            "   “Wheres the aspirin?” He glanced at the water-glass she handed him.\n",
            "   “Oh.” She walked to the bathroom again. “Did something happen?”\n",
            "   “A fire, is all.”\n",
            "   “I had a nice evening,” she said, in the bathroom.\n",
            "   “What doing?”\n",
            "   “The parlour.”\n",
            "   “What was on?”\n",
            "   “Programmes.”\n",
            "   “What programmes?”\n",
            "   “Some of the best ever.”\n",
            "   “Who?”.\n",
            "   “Oh, you know, the bunch.”\n",
            "   “Yes, the bunch, the bunch, the bunch.” He pressed at the pain in his eyes and suddenly the odour of kerosene made him vomit.\n",
            "   Mildred came in, humming. She was surprised. “Whyd you do that?”\n",
            "   He looked with dismay at the floor. “We burned an old woman with her books.”\n",
            "   “Its a good thing the rugs washable.” She fetched a mop and worked on it. “I went to Helens last night.”\n",
            "   “Couldnt you get the shows in your own parlour?”\n",
            "   “Sure, but its nice visiting.”\n",
            "   She went out into the parlour. He heard her singing.\n",
            "   “Mildred?” he called.\n",
            "   She returned, singing, snapping her fingers softly.\n",
            "   “Arent you going to ask me about last night?” he said.\n",
            "   “What about it?”\n",
            "   “We burned a thousand books. We burned a woman.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   The parlour was exploding with sound.\n",
            "   “We burned copies of Dante and Swift and Marcus Aurelius.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a European?”\n",
            "   “Something like that.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a radical?”\n",
            "   “I never read him.”\n",
            "   “He was a radical.” Mildred fiddled with the telephone. “You dont expect me to call Captain Beatty, do you?”\n",
            "   “You must!”\n",
            "   “Dont shout!”\n",
            "   “I wasnt shouting.” He was up in bed, suddenly, enraged and flushed, shaking. The parlour roared in the hot air. “I cant call him. I cant tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   Because youre afraid, he thought. A child feigning illness, afraid to call because after a moments discussion, the conversation would run so: “Yes, Captain, I feel better already. Ill be in at ten oclock tonight.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag fell back in bed. He reached under his pillow. The hidden book was still there.\n",
            "   “Mildred, how would it be if, well, maybe, I quit my job awhile?”\n",
            "   “You want to give up everything? After all these years of working, because, one night, some woman and her books—”\n",
            "   “You should have seen her, Millie!”\n",
            "   “Shes nothing to me; she shouldnt have had books. It was her responsibility, she should have thought of that. I hate her. Shes got you going and next thing you know well be out, no house, no job, nothing.”\n",
            "   “You werent there, you didnt see,” he said. “There must be something in books, things we cant imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You dont stay for nothing.”\n",
            "   “She was simple-minded.”\n",
            "   “She was as rational as you and I, more so perhaps, and we burned her.”\n",
            "   “Thats water under the bridge.”\n",
            "   “No, not water; fire. You ever seen a burned house? It smoulders for days. Well, this firell last me the rest of my life. God! Ive been trying to put it out, in my mind, all night. Im crazy with trying.”\n",
            "   “You should have thought of that before becoming a fireman.”\n",
            "   “Thought!” he said. “Was I given a choice? My grandfather and father were firemen. In my sleep, I ran after them.”\n",
            "   The parlour was playing a dance tune.\n",
            "   “This is the day you go on the early shift,” said Mildred. “You should have gone two hours ago. I just noticed.”\n",
            "   “Its not just the woman that died,” said Montag. “Last night I thought about all the kerosene Ive used in the past ten years. And I thought about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And Id never even thought that thought before.” He got out of bed.\n",
            "   “It took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down, looking around at the world and life, and then I came along in two minutes and boom! its all over.”\n",
            "   “Let me alone,” said Mildred. “I didnt do anything.”\n",
            "   “Let you alone! Thats all very well, but how can I leave myself alone? We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?”\n",
            "   And then he shut up, for he remembered last week and the two white stones staring up at the ceiling and the pump-snake with the probing eye and the two soap-faced men with the cigarettes moving in their mouths when they talked. But that was another Mildred, that was a Mildred so deep inside this one, and so bothered, really bothered, that the two women had never met. He turned away.\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Well, now youve done it. Out front of the house. Look whos here.”.\n",
            "   “I dont care.”\n",
            "   “Theres a Phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt with an orange snake stitched on his arm coming up the front walk.”\n",
            "   “Captain Beauty?” he said,\n",
            "   “Captain Beatty.”\n",
            "   Montag did not move, but stood looking into the cold whiteness of the wall immediately before him.\n",
            "   “Go let him in, will you? Tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Tell him yourself!” She ran a few steps this way, a few steps that, and stopped, eyes wide, when the front door speaker called her name, softly, softly, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someones here. Fading.\n",
            "   Montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow, climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half-sitting, and after a while Mildred moved and went out of the room and Captain Beatty strolled in, his hands in his pockets.\n",
            "   “Shut the ‘relatives’ up,” said Beatty, looking around at everything except Montag and his wife.\n",
            "   This time, Mildred ran. The yammering voices stopped yelling in the parlour.\n",
            "   Captain Beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a peaceful look on his ruddy face. He took time to prepare and light his brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud. “Just thought Id come by and see how the sick man is.”\n",
            "   “Howd you guess?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his gums and the tiny candy whiteness of his teeth. “Ive seen it all. You were going to call for a night off.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “take the night off!” He examined his eternal matchbox, the lid of which said GUARANTEED: ONE MILLION LIGHTS IN THIS IGNITER, and began to strike the chemical match abstractedly, blow out, strike, blow out, strike, speak a few words, blow out. He looked at the flame. He blew, he looked at the smoke. “When will you be well?”\n",
            "   “Tomorrow. The next day maybe. First of the week.”\n",
            "   Beatty puffed his pipe. “Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession. They dont feed it to rookies like they used to. Damn shame.” Puff. “Only fire chiefs remember it now.” Puff. “Ill let you in on it.”\n",
            "   Mildred fidgeted.\n",
            "   Beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for what he wanted to say.\n",
            "   “When did it all start, you ask, this job of ours, how did it come about, where, when? Well, Id say it really got started around about a thing called the Civil War. Even though our rule-book claims it was founded earlier. The fact is we didnt get along well until photography came into its own. Then—motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed, not moving.\n",
            "   “And because they had mass, they became simpler,” said Beatty. “Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books levelled down to a sort of paste pudding norm, do you follow me?”\n",
            "   “I think so.”\n",
            "   Beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air. “Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending.”\n",
            "   “Snap ending.” Mildred nodded.\n",
            "   “Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a tenor twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: ‘now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.’ Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; theres your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.”\n",
            "   Mildred arose and began to move around the room, picking things up and putting them down. Beatty ignored her and continued\n",
            "   “Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl mans mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary, time-wasting thought!”\n",
            "   Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and jump again as she patted his pillow. Right now she was pulling at his shoulder to try to get him to move so she could take the pillow out and fix it nicely and put it back. And perhaps cry out and stare or simply reach down her hand and say, “Whats this?” and hold up the hidden book with touching innocence.\n",
            "   “School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages dropped, English and spelling gradually neglected, finally almost completely ignored. Life is immediate, the job counts, pleasure lies all about after work. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts?”\n",
            "   “Let me fix your pillow,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “No!” whispered Montag,\n",
            "   “The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at. dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.”\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Here.”\n",
            "   “Get away,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Life becomes one big pratfall, Montag; everything bang; boff, and wow!”\n",
            "   “Wow,” said Mildred, yanking at the pillow.\n",
            "   “For Gods sake, let me be!” cried Montag passionately.\n",
            "   Beatty opened his eyes wide.\n",
            "   Mildreds hand had frozen behind the pillow. Her fingers were tracing the books outline and as the shape became familiar her face looked surprised and then stunned. Her mouth opened to ask a question...\n",
            "   “Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colours running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or sauterne. You like baseball, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Baseballs a fine game.”\n",
            "   Now Beatty was almost invisible, a voice somewhere behind a screen of smoke\n",
            "   “Whats this?” asked Mildred, almost with delight. Montag heaved back against her arms. “Whats this here?”\n",
            "   “Sit down!” Montag shouted. She jumped away, her hands empty. “Were talking!”\n",
            "   Beatty went on as if nothing had happened. “You like bowling, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Bowling, yes.”\n",
            "   “And golf?”\n",
            "   “Golf is a fine game.”\n",
            "   “Basketball?”\n",
            "   “A fine game.”.\n",
            "   “Billiards, pool? Football?”\n",
            "   “Fine games, all of them.”\n",
            "   “More sports for everyone, group spirit, fun, and you dont have to think, eh? Organize and organize and superorganize super-super sports. More cartoons in books. More pictures. The mind drinks less and less. Impatience. Highways full of crowds going somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, nowhere. The gasoline refugee. Towns turn into motels, people in nomadic surges from place to place, following the moon tides, living tonight in the room where you slept this noon and I the night before.”\n",
            "   Mildred went out of the room and slammed the door. The parlour “aunts” began to laugh at the parlour “uncles.”,\n",
            "   “Now lets take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Dont step on the toes of the dog?lovers, the cat?lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second?generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic?books survive. And the three?dimensional sex?magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didnt come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade?journals.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but what about the firemen, then?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Ah.” Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. “What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word ‘intellectual,’ of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally ‘bright,’ did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasnt it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach mans mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well?read man? Me? I wont stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. Thats you, Montag, and thats me.”\n",
            "   The door to the parlour opened and Mildred stood there looking in at them, looking at Beatty and then at Montag. Behind her the walls of the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of trap?drums, tom?toms, and cymbals. Her mouth moved and she was saying something but the sound covered it.\n",
            "   Beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand, studied the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for meaning.\n",
            "   “You must understand that our civilization is so vast that we cant have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isnt that right? Havent you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well, arent they? Dont we keep them moving, dont we give them fun? Thats all we live for, isnt it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these.”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Montag could lip?read what Mildred was saying in the doorway. He tried not to look at her mouth, because then Beatty might turn and read what was there, too.\n",
            "   “Coloured people dont like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people dont feel good about Uncle Toms Cabin. Burn it. Someones written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Bum the book. Serenity, Montag. Peace, Montag. Take your fight outside. Better yet, into the incinerator. Funerals are unhappy and pagan? Eliminate them, too. Five minutes after a person is dead hes on his way to the Big Flue, the Incinerators serviced by helicopters all over the country. Ten minutes after death a mans a speck of black dust. Lets not quibble over individuals with memoriams. Forget them. Burn them all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean.”\n",
            "   The fireworks died in the parlour behind Mildred. She had stopped talking at the same time; a miraculous coincidence. Montag held his breath.\n",
            "   “There was a girl next door,” he said, slowly. “Shes gone now, I think, dead. I cant even remember her face. But she was different. How?how did she happen?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled. “Here or there, thats bound to occur. Clarisse McClellan? Weve a record on her family. Weve watched them carefully. Heredity and environment are funny things. You cant rid yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. Thats why weve lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now were almost snatching them from the cradle. We had some false alarms on the McClellans, when they lived in Chicago. Never found a book. Uncle had a mixed record; anti?social. The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, Im sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didnt want to know how a thing was done, but why. That can be embarrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girls better off dead.”\n",
            "   “Yes, dead.”\n",
            "   “Luckily, queer ones like her dont happen, often. We know how to nip most of them in the bud, early. You cant build a house without nails and wood. If you dont want a house built, hide the nails and wood. If you dont want a man unhappy politically, dont give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the Government is inefficient, top?heavy, and tax?mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of non?combustible data, chock them so damned full of ‘facts’ they feel stuffed, but absolutely ‘brilliant’ with information. Then theyll feel theyre thinking, theyll get a sense of motion without moving. And theyll be happy, because facts of that sort dont change. Dont give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide?rule, measure, and equate the universe, which just wont be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely. I know, Ive tried it; to hell with it. So bring on your clubs and parties, your acrobats and magicians, your dare-devils, jet cars, motor?cycle helicopters, your sex and heroin, more of everything to do with automatic reflex. If the drama is bad, if the film says nothing, if the play is hollow, sting me with the theremin, loudly. Ill think Im responding to the play, when its only a tactile reaction to vibration. But I dont care. I just like solid entertainment.”\n",
            "   Beatty got up. “I must be going. Lectures over. I hope Ive clarified things. The important thing for you to remember, Montag, is were the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dyke. Hold steady. Dont let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world. We depend on you. I dont think you realize how important you are, to our happy world as it stands now.”\n",
            "   Beatty shook Montags limp hand. Montag still sat, as if the house were collapsing about him and he could not move, in the bed. Mildred had vanished from the door.\n",
            "   “One last thing,” said Beatty. “At least once in his career, every fireman gets an itch. What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, Ive had to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. Theyre about non?existent people, figments of imagination, if theyre fiction. And if theyre non?fiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher screaming down anothers gullet. All of them running about, putting out the stars and extinguishing the sun. You come away lost.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, what if a fireman accidentally, really not, intending anything, takes a book home with him?”\n",
            "   Montag twitched. The open door looked at him with its great vacant eye.\n",
            "   “A natural error. Curiosity alone,” said Beatty. “We dont get over?anxious or mad. We let the fireman keep the book twenty?four hours. If he hasnt burned it by then, we simply come and burn it for him.”\n",
            "   “Of course.” Montags mouth was dry.\n",
            "   “Well, Montag. Will you take another, later shift, today? Will we see you tonight perhaps?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What?” Beatty looked faintly surprised.\n",
            "   Montag shut his eyes. “Ill be in later. Maybe.”\n",
            "   “Wed certainly miss you if you didnt show,” said Beatty, putting his pipe in his pocket thoughtfully.\n",
            "   Ill never come in again, thought Montag.\n",
            "   “Get well and keep well,” said Beatty.\n",
            "   He turned and went out through the open door.\n",
            "   Montag watched through the window as Beatty drove away in his gleaming yellow?flame?coloured beetle with the black, char?coloured tyres.\n",
            "   Across the street and down the way the other houses stood with their flat fronts. What was it Clarisse had said one afternoon? “No front porches. My uncle says there used to be front porches. And people sat there sometimes at night, talking when they wanted to talk, rocking, and not talking when they didnt want to talk. Sometimes they just sat there and thought about things, turned things over. My uncle says the architects got rid of the front porches because they didnt look well. But my uncle says that was merely rationalizing it; the real reason, hidden underneath, might be they didnt want people sitting like that, doing nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life. People talked too much. And they had time to think. So they ran off with the porches. And the gardens, too. Not many gardens any more to sit around in. And look at the furniture. No rocking?chairs any more. Theyre too comfortable. Get people up and running around. My uncle says... and... my uncle... and... my uncle...” Her voice faded.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Montag turned and looked at his wife, who sat in the middle of the parlour talking to an announcer, who in turn was talking to her. “Mrs. Montag,” he was saying. This, that and the other. “Mrs. Montag?” Something else and still another. The converter attachment, which had cost them one hundred dollars, automatically supplied her name whenever the announcer addressed his anonymous audience, leaving a blank where the proper syllables could be filled in. A special spot?wavex?scrambler also caused his televised image, in the area immediately about his lips, to mouth the vowels and consonants beautifully. He was a friend, no doubt of it, a good friend. “Mrs. Montag?now look right here.”\n",
            "   Her head turned. Though she quite obviously was not listening.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Its only a step from not going to work today to not working tomorrow, to not working at the firehouse ever again.”,\n",
            "   “You are going to work tonight, though, arent you?” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “I havent decided. Right now Ive got an awful feeling I want to smash things and kill things:\n",
            "   “Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No thanks.”\n",
            "   “The keys to the beetle are on the night table. I always like to drive fast when I feel that way. You get it up around ninetyfive and you feel wonderful. Sometimes I drive all night and come back and you dont know it. Its fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs. Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No, I dont want to, this time. I want to hold on to this funny thing. God, its gotten big on me. I dont know what it is. Im so damned unhappy, Im so mad, and I dont know why I feel like Im putting on weight. I feel fat. I feel like Ive been saving up a lot of things, and dont know what. I might even start reading books.”\n",
            "   “Theyd put you in jail, wouldnt they?” She looked at him as if he were behind the glass wall.\n",
            "   He began to put on his clothes, moving restlessly about the bedroom. “Yes, and it might be a good idea. Before I hurt someone. Did you hear Beatty? Did you listen to him? He knows all the answers. Hes right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept sitting there saying to myself, Im not happy, Im not happy.”\n",
            "   “I am.” Mildreds mouth beamed. “And proud of it.”\n",
            "   “Im going to do something,” said Montag. “I dont even know what yet, but Im going to do something big.”\n",
            "   “Im tired of listening to this junk,” said Mildred, turning from him to the announcer again\n",
            "   Montag touched the volume control in the wall and the announcer was speechless.\n",
            "   “Millie?” He paused. “This is your house as well as mine. I feel its only fair that I tell you something now. I should have told you before, but I wasnt even admitting it to myself. I have something I want you to see, something Ive put away and hid during the past year, now and again, once in a while, I didnt know why, but I did it and I never told you.”\n",
            "   He took hold of a straight?backed chair and moved it slowly and steadily into the hall near the front door and climbed up on it and stood for a moment like a statue on a pedestal, his wife standing under him, waiting. Then he reached up and pulled back the grille of the air?conditioning system and reached far back inside to the right and moved still another sliding sheet of metal and took out a book. Without looking at it he dropped it to the floor. He put his hand back up and took out two books and moved his hand down and dropped the two books to the floor. He kept moving his hand and dropping books, small ones, fairly large ones, yellow, red, green ones. When he was done he looked down upon some twenty books lying at his wifes feet.\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” he said. “I didnt really think. But now it looks as if were in this together.”\n",
            "   Mildred backed away as if she were suddenly confronted by a pack of mice that had come up out of the floor. He could hear her breathing rapidly and her face was paled out and her eyes were fastened wide. She said his name over, twice, three times. Then moaning, she ran forward, seized a book and ran toward the kitchen incinerator.\n",
            "   He caught her, shrieking. He held her and she tried to fight away from him, scratching.\n",
            "   “No, Millie, no! Wait! Stop it, will you? You dont know... stop it!” He slapped her face, he grabbed her again and shook her.\n",
            "   She said his name and began to cry.\n",
            "   “Millie!” he said. “Listen. Give me a second, will you? We cant do anything. We cant burn these. I want to look at them, at least look at them once. Then if what the Captain says is true, well burn them together, believe me, well burn them together. You must help me.” He looked down into her face and took hold of her chin and held her firmly. He was looking not only at her, but for himself and what he must do, in her face. “Whether we like this or not, were in it. Ive never asked for much from you in all these years, but I ask it now, I plead for it. Weve got to start somewhere here, figuring out why were in such a mess, you and the medicine at night, and the car, and me and my work. Were heading right for the cliff, Millie. God, I dont want to go over. This isnt going to be easy. We havent anything to go on, but maybe we can piece it out and figure it and help each other. I need you so much right now, I cant tell you. If you love me at all youll put up with this, twenty?four, forty?eight hours, thats all I ask, then itll be over. I promise, I swear! And if there is something here, just one little thing out of a whole mess of things, maybe we can pass it on to someone else.”\n",
            "   She wasnt fighting any more, so he let her go. She sagged away from him and slid down the wall, and sat on the floor looking at the books. Her foot touched one and she saw this and pulled her foot away.\n",
            "   “That woman, the other night, Millie, you werent there. You didnt see her face. And Clarisse. You never talked to her. I talked to her. And men like Beatty are afraid of her. I cant understand it. Why should they be so afraid of someone like her? But I kept putting her alongside the firemen in the house last night, and I suddenly realized I didnt like them at all, and I didnt like myself at all any more. And I thought maybe it would be best if the firemen themselves were burnt.”\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   The front door voice called softly:\n",
            "   “Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here.”\n",
            "   Softly.\n",
            "   They turned to stare at the door and the books toppled everywhere, everywhere in heaps.\n",
            "   “Beatty!” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “It cant be him.”\n",
            "   “Hes come back!” she whispered.\n",
            "   The front door voice called again softly. “Someone here...”\n",
            "   “We wont answer.” Montag lay back against the wall and then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books, bewilderedly, with his thumb, his forefinger. He was shivering and he wanted above all to shove the books up through the ventilator again, but he knew he could not face Beatty again. He crouched and then he sat and the voice of the front door spoke again, more insistently. Montag picked a single small volume from the floor. “Where do we begin?” He opened the book half?way and peered at it. “We begin by beginning, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Hell come in,” said Mildred, “and burn us and the books!”\n",
            "   The front door voice faded at last. There was a silence. Montag felt the presence of someone beyond the door, waiting, listening. Then the footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn.\n",
            "   “Lets see what this is,” said Montag.\n",
            "   He spoke the words haltingly and with a terrible selfconsciousness. He read a dozen pages here and there and came at last to this:\n",
            "   “It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death rather than submit to break eggs at the smaller end.”\n",
            "   Mildred sat across the hall from him. “What does it mean? It doesnt mean anything! The Captain was right!”\n",
            "   “Here now,” said Montag. “Well start over again, at the beginning.”\n",

            "   THEY read the long afternoon through, while the cold November rain fell from the sky upon the quiet house. They sat in the hall because the parlour was so empty and grey-looking without its walls lit with orange and yellow confetti and sky-rockets and women in gold-mesh dresses and men in black velvet pulling one-hundred-pound rabbits from silver hats. The parlour was dead and Mildred kept peering in at it with a blank expression as Montag paced the floor and came back and squatted down and read a page as many as ten times, aloud.\n",
            "   “We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over, so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.”\n",

            "   “Is that what it was in the girl next door? Ive tried so hard to figure.”\n",
            "   “Shes dead. Lets talk about someone alive, for goodness’ sake.”\n",
            "   Montag did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along the hall to the kitchen, where he stood a long. time watching the rain hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the grey light, waiting for the tremble to subside.\n",
            "   He opened another book.\n",
            "   “That favourite subject, Myself.”\n",
            "   He squinted at the wall. “The favourite subject, Myself.”\n",
            "   “I understand that one,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “But Clarisses favourite subject wasnt herself. It was everyone else, and me. She was the first person in a good many years Ive really liked. She was the first person I can remember who looked straight at me as if I counted.” He lifted the two books. “These men have been dead a long time, but I know their words point, one way or another, to Clansse.”\n",
            "   Outside the front door, in the rain, a faint scratching.\n",
            "   Montag froze. He saw Mildred thrust herself back to the wall and gasp.\n",
            "   “I shut it off.”\n",
            "   “Someone—the door—why doesnt the door-voice tell us—”\n",
            "   Under the door-sill, a slow, probing sniff, an exhalation of electric steam.\n",
            "   Mildred laughed. “Its only a dog, thats what! You want me to shoo him away?”\n",
            "   “Stay where you are!”\n",
            "   Silence. The cold rain falling. And the smell of blue electricity blowing under the locked door.\n",
            "   “Lets get back to work,” said Montag quietly.\n",
            "   Mildred kicked at a book. “Books arent people. You read and I look around, but there isnt anybody!”\n",
            "   He stared at the parlour that was dead and grey as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun.\n",
            "   “Now,” said Mildred, “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh! And the colours!”\n",
            "   “Yes, I know.”\n",
            "   “And besides, if Captain Beatty knew about those books—” She thought about it. Her face grew amazed and then horrified. “He might come and bum the house and the ‘family.’ Thats awful! Think of our investment. Why should I read? What for?”\n",
            "   “What for! Why!” said Montag. “I saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. It was dead but it was alive. It could see but it couldnt see. You want to see that snake. Its at Emergency Hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! Would you like to go and check their file? Maybe youd look under Guy Montag or maybe under Fear or War. Would you like to go to that house that burnt last night? And rake ashes for the bones of the woman who set fire to her own house! What about Clarisse McClellan, where do we look for her? The morgue! Listen!”\n",
            "   The bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house, gasping, murmuring, whistling like an immense, invisible fan, circling in emptiness.\n",
            "   “Jesus God,” said Montag. “Every hour so many damn things in the sky! How in hell did those bombers get up there every single second of our lives! Why doesnt someone want to talk about it? Weve started and won two atomic wars since 1960. Is it because were having so much fun at home weve forgotten the world? Is it because were so rich and the rest of the worlds so poor and we just dont care if they are? Ive heard rumours; the world is starving, but were well-fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why were hated so much? Ive heard the rumours about hate, too, once in a long while, over the years. Do you know why? I dont, thats sure! Maybe the books can get us half out of the cave. They just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes! I dont hear those idiot bastards in your parlour talking about it. God, Millie, dont you see? An hour a day, two hours, with these books, and maybe...”\n",
            "   The telephone rang. Mildred snatched the phone.\n",
            "   “Ann!” She laughed. “Yes, the White Clowns on tonight!”\n",
            "   Montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down. “Montag,” he said, “youre really stupid. Where do we go from here? Do we turn the books in, forget it?” He opened the book to read over Mildreds laughter.\n",
            "   Poor Millie, he thought. Poor Montag, its mud to you, too. But where do you get help, where do you find a teacher this late?\n",
            "   Hold on. He shut his eyes. Yes, of course. Again he found himself thinking of the green park a year ago. The thought had been with him many times recently, but now he remembered how it was that day in the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide something, quickly in his coat .\n",
            "   ...The old man leapt up as if to run. And Montag said, “Wait!”\n",
            "   “I havent done anything!” cried the old man trembling.\n",
            "   “No one said you did.”\n",
            "   They had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a moment, and then Montag talked about the weather, and then the old man responded with a pale voice. It was a strange quiet meeting. The old man admitted to being a retired English professor who had been thrown out upon the world forty years ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and patronage. His name was Faber, and when he finally lost his fear of Montag, he talked in a cadenced voice, looking at the sky and the trees and the green park, and when an hour had passed he said something to Montag and Montag sensed it was a rhymeless poem. Then the old man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was a poem, too. Faber held his hand over his left coat-pocket and spoke these words gently, and Montag knew if he reached out, he might pull a book of poetry from the mans coat. But he did not reach out. His. hands stayed on his knees, numbed and useless. “I dont talk things, sir,” said Faber. “I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know Im alive.”\n",
            "   That was all there was to it, really. An hour of monologue, a poem, a comment, and then without even acknowledging the fact that Montag was a fireman, Faber with a certain trembling, wrote his address on a slip of paper. “For your file,” he said, “in case you decide to be angry with me.”\n",
            "   “Im not angry,” Montag said, surprised.\n",
            "   Mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall.\n",
            "   Montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his file-wallet to the heading: FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS (?). Fabers name was there. He hadnt turned it in and he hadnt erased it.\n",
            "   He dialled the call on a secondary phone. The phone on the far end of the line called Fabers name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice. Montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence. “Yes, Mr. Montag?”\n",
            "   “Professor Faber, I have a rather odd question to ask. How many copies of the Bible are left in this country?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what youre talking about!”\n",
            "   “I want to know if there are any copies left at all.”\n",
            "   “This is some sort of a trap! I cant talk to just anyone on the phone!”\n",
            "   “How many copies of Shakespeare and Plato?”\n",
            "   “None! You know as well as I do. None!”\n",
            "   Faber hung up.\n",
            "   Montag put down the phone. None. A thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings. But somehow he had wanted to hear it from Faber himself.\n",
            "   In the hall Mildreds face was suffused with excitement. “Well, the ladies are coming over!”\n",
            "   Montag showed her a book. “This is the Old and New Testament, and-”\n",
            "   “Dont start that again!”\n",
            "   “It might be the last copy in this part of the world.”\n",
            "   “Youve got to hand it back tonight, dont you know? Captain Beatty knows youve got it, doesnt he?”\n",
            "   “I dont think he knows which book I stole. But how do I choose a substitute? Do I turn in Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Thoreau? Which is least valuable? If I pick a substitute and Beatty does know which book I stole, hell guess weve an entire library here!”\n",
            "   Mildreds mouth twitched. “See what youre doing? Youll ruin us! Whos more important, me or that Bible?” She was beginning to shriek now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat.\n",
            "   He could hear Beattys voice. “Sit down, Montag. Watch. Delicately, like the petals of a flower. Light the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly. Beautiful, eh? Light the third page from the second and so on, chainsmoking, chapter by chapter, all the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, all the second-hand notions and time-worn philosophies.” There sat Beatty, perspiring gently, the floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm\n",
            "   Mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started. Montag was not listening. “Theres only one thing to do,” he said. “Some time before tonight when I give the book to Beatty, Ive got to have a duplicate made.”\n",
            "   “Youll be here for the White Clown tonight, and the ladies coming over?” cried Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag stopped at the door, with his back turned. “Millie?”\n",
            "   A silence “What?”\n",
            "   “Millie? Does the White Clown love you?”\n",
            "   No answer.\n",
            "   “Millie, does—” He licked his lips. “Does your ‘family’ love you, love you very much, love you with all their heart\n",
            "   and soul, Millie?”\n",
            "   He felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck.\n",
            "   “Whyd you ask a silly question like that?”\n",
            "   He felt he wanted to cry, but nothing would happen to his eyes or his mouth.\n",
            "   “If you see that dog outside,” said Mildred, “give him a kick for me.”\n",
            "   He hesitated, listening at the door. He opened it and stepped out.\n",
            "   The rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky. The street and the lawn and the porch were empty. He let his breath go in a great sigh.\n",
            "   He slammed the door.\n",
            "   He was on the subway.\n",
            "   Im numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill-bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\n",
            "   The numbness will go away, he thought. Itll take time, but Ill do it, or Faber will do it for me. Someone somewhere will give me back the old face and the old hands the way they were. Even the smile, he thought, the old burnt-in smile, thats gone. Im lost without it.\n",
            "   The subway fled past him, cream-tile, jet-black, cream-tile, jet-black, numerals and darkness, more darkness and the total adding itself.\n",
            "   Once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the middle of the blue and hot summer day, trying to fill a sieve with sand, because some cruel cousin had said, “Fill this sieve and youll get a dime!” And the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through with a hot whispering. His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty. Seated there in the midst of July, without a sound, he felt the tears move down his cheeks.\n",
            "   Now as the vacuum-underground rushed him through the dead cellars of town, jolting him, he remembered the terrible logic of that sieve, and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the Bible open. There were people in the suction train but he held the book in his hands and the silly thought came to him, if you read fast and read all, maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve. But he read and the words fell through, and he thought, in a few hours, there will be Beatty, and here will be me handing this over, so no phrase must escape me, each line must be memorized. I will myself to do it.\n",
            "   He clenched the book in his fists.\n",
            "   Trumpets blared.\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentrifice.”\n",
            "   Shut up, thought Montag. Consider the lilies of the field.\n",

            "   “Dentifrice!”\n",
            "   He tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt them as if he were blind, he picked at the shape of the individual letters, not blinking.\n",

            "   They toil not, neither do they...\n",

The people who had been sitting a moment before, tapping their feet to the rhythm of Denhams Dentifrice, Denhams Dandy Dental Detergent, Denhams Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice, one two, one two three, one two, one two three. The people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the words Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice. The train radio vomited upon Montag, in retaliation, a great ton-load of music made of tin, copper, silver, chromium, and brass. The people wcre pounded into submission; they did not run, there was no place to run; the great air-train fell down its shaft in the earth.\n",

Only then. did he leap past the other passengers, screaming in his mind, plunge through the slicing door only in time. He ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels, ignoring the escalators, because he wanted to feel his feet-move, arms swing, lungs clench, unclench, feel his throat go raw with air. A voice drifted after him, “Denhams Denhams Denhams,” the train hissed like a snake. The train vanished in its hole.\n",

The old man looked as if he had not been out of the house in years. He and the white plaster walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded, with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the book under Montags arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile. Slowly his fear went.\n",
            "   “Im sorry. One has to be careful.”\n",
            "   He looked at the book under Montags arm and could not stop. “So its true.”\n",
            "   Montag stepped inside. The door shut.\n",
            "   “Sit down.” Faber backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desk-top. Montag had only a glimpse, before Faber, seeing Montags attention diverted, turned quickly and shut the bedroom door and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand. His gaze returned unsteadily to Montag, who was now seated with the book in his lap. “The book-where did you-?”\n",
            "   “I stole it.”\n",
            "   Faber, for the first time, raised his eyes and looked directly into Montags face. “Youre brave.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Montag. “My wifes dying. A friend of mines already dead. Someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twenty-four hours ago. Youre the only one I knew might help me. To see. To see..”\n",
            "   Fabers hands itched on his knees. “May I?”\n",
            "   “Sorry.” Montag gave him the book.\n",
            "   “Its been a long time. Im not a religious man. But its been a long time.” Faber turned the pages, stopping here and there to read. “Its as good as I remember. Lord, how theyve changed itin our ‘parlours’ these days. Christ is one of the ‘family’ now. I often wonder it God recognizes His own son the way weve dressed him up, or is it dressed him down? Hes a regular peppermint stick now, all sugar-crystal and saccharine when he isnt making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs.” Faber sniffed the book. “Do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land? I loved to smell them when I was a boy. Lord, there were a lot of lovely books once, before we let them go.” Faber turned the pages. “Mr. Montag, you are looking at a coward. I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. Im one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the ‘guilty,’ but I did not speak and thus became guilty myself. And when finally they set the structure to burn the books, using the, firemen, I grunted a few times and subsided, for there were no others grunting or yelling with me, by then. Now, its too late.” Faber closed the Bible. “Well—suppose you tell me why you came here?”\n",
            "   “Nobody listens any more. I cant talk to the walls because theyre yelling at me. I cant talk to my wife; she listens to the walls. I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, itll make sense. And I want you to teach me to understand what I read.”\n",
            "   Faber examined Montags thin, blue-jowled face. “How did you get shaken up? What knocked the torch out of your hands?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we arent happy. Somethings missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books Id burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.”\n",
            "   “Youre a hopeless romantic,” said Faber. “It would be funny if it were not serious. Its not books you need, its some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the ‘parlour families’ today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, its not books at all youre looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldnt know this, of course you still cant understand what I mean when I say all this. You are intuitively right, thats what counts. Three things are missing.\n",
            "   “Number one: Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. Youd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. Thats my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\n",
            "   “So now do you see why books are hated and feared? They show the pores in the face of life. The comfortable people want only wax moon faces, poreless, hairless, expressionless. We are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers, instead of growing on good rain and black loam. Even fireworks, for all their prettiness, come from the chemistry of the earth. Yet somehow we think we can grow, feeding on flowers and fireworks, without completing the cycle back to reality. Do you know the legend of Hercules and Antaeus, the giant wrestler, whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth. But when he was held, rootless, in mid-air, by Hercules, he perished easily. If there isnt something in that legend for us today, in this city, in our time, then I am completely insane. Well, there we have the first thing I said we needed. Quality, texture of information.”\n",

            "   “Oh, but weve plenty of off-hours.”\n",
            "   “Off-hours, yes. But time to think? If youre not driving a hundred miles an hour, at a clip where you cant think of anything else but the danger, then youre playing some game or sitting in some room where you cant argue with the fourwall televisor. Why? The televisor is ‘real.’ It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be, right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasnt time to protest, ‘What nonsense!”\n",
            "   “Only the ‘family’ is ‘people.’”\n",

            "   “Thank God for that. You can shut them, say, ‘Hold on a moment.’ You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlour? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is the truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and scepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full colour, three dimensions, and I being in and part of those incredible parlours. As you see, my parlour is nothing but four plaster walls. And here” He held out two small rubber plugs. “For my ears when I ride the subway-jets.”\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentifrice; they toil not, neither do they spin,” said Montag, eyes shut. “Where do we go from here? Would books help us?”\n",
            "   “Only if the third necessary thing could be given us. Number one, as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the inter-action of the first two. And I hardly think a very old man and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game...”\n",

            "   “There, youve said an interesting thing,” laughed Faber, “without having read it!”\n",
            "   “Are things like that in books. But it came off the top of my mind!”\n",
            "   “All the better. You didnt fancy it up for me or anyone, even yourself.”\n",
            "   Montag leaned forward. “This afternoon I thought that if it turned out that books were worth while, we might get a press and print some extra copies—”\n",
            "   “ We?”\n",
            "   “You and I”\n",

            "   “Not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for my trouble. The only way I could possibly listen to you would be if somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt. Now if you suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in firemens houses all over the country, so that seeds of suspicion would be sown among these arsonists, bravo, Id say!”\n",
            "   “Plant the books, turn in an alarm, and see the firemens houses bum, is that what you mean?”\n",
            "   Faber raised his brows and looked at Montag as if he were seeing a new man. “I was joking.”\n",
            "   “If you thought it would be a plan worth trying, Id have to take your word it would help.”\n",
            "   “You cant guarantee things like that! After all, when we had all the books we needed, we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to jump off. But we do need a breather. We do need knowledge. And perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off. The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are. Theyre Caesars praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, ‘Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.’ Most of us cant rush around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we havent time, money or that many friends. The things youre looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Dont ask for guarantees. And dont look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.”\n",

            "   “Absolutely.”\n",
            "   “Its an insidious plan, if I do say so myself.” Faber glanced nervously at his bedroom door. “To see the firehouses burn across the land, destroyed as hotbeds of treason. The salamander devours his tail! Ho, God!”\n",
            "   “Ive a list of firemens residences everywhere. With some sort of underground”\n",

Good God, it isnt as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord. You firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze, but its a small sideshow indeed, and hardly necessary to keep things in line. So few want to be rebels any more. And out of those few, most, like myself, scare easily. Can you dance faster than the White Clown, shout louder than ‘Mr. Gimmick’ and the parlour ‘families’? If you can, youll win your way, Montag. In any event, youre a fool. People are having fun”\n",

How like a beautiful statue of ice it was, melting in the sun. I remember the newspapers dying like huge moths. No one wanted them back. No one missed them. And the Government, seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about passionate lips and the fist in the stomach, circled the situation with your fire-eaters. So, Montag, theres this unemployed printer. We might start a few books, and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us the push we need. A few bombs and the ‘families’ in the walls of all the houses, like harlequin rats, will shut up! In silence, our stage-whisper might carry.”\n",

Only a week ago, pumping a kerosene hose, I thought: God, what fun!”\n",

That day in the park when we sat together, I knew that some day you might drop by, with fire or friendship, it was hard to guess. Ive had this little item ready for months.

If you put it in your ear, Montag, I can sit comfortably home, warming my frightened bones, and hear and analyse the firemens world, find its weaknesses, without danger. Im the Queen Bee, safe in the hive. You will be the drone, the travelling ear. Eventually, I could put out ears into all parts of the city, with various men, listening and evaluating. If the drones die, Im still safe at home, tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of chance. See how safe I play it, how contemptible I am?”\n",

            "   He was eating a light supper at nine in the evening when the front door cried out in the hall and Mildred ran from the parlour like a native fleeing an eruption of Vesuvius. Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came through the front door and vanished into the volcanos mouth with martinis in their hands: Montag stopped eating. They were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw their Cheshire Cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and now they were screaming at each other above the din. Montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his mouth.\n",
            "   “Doesnt everyone look nice!”\n",
            "   “Nice.”\n",
            "   “You look fine, Millie!”\n",
            "   “Fine.”\n",
            "   “Everyone looks swell.”\n",
            "   “Swell!\n",
            "   “Montag stood watching them.\n",
            "   “Patience,” whispered Faber.\n",
            "   “I shouldnt be here,” whispered Montag, almost to himself. “I should be on my way back to you with the money!” “Tomorrows time enough. Careful!”\n",
            "   “Isnt this show wonderful?” cried Mildred. “Wonderful!”\n",
            "   On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought Montag, insanely. In the other walls an X-ray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delightful stomach! Abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into the clouds, it plunged into a lime-green sea where blue fish ate red and yellow fish. A minute later, Three White Cartoon Clowns chopped off each others limbs to the accompaniment of immense incoming tides of laughter. Two minutes more and the room whipped out of town to the jet cars wildly circling an arena, bashing and backing up and bashing each other again. Montag saw a number of bodies fly in the air.\n",
            "   “Millie, did you see that?”\n",
            "   “I saw it, I saw it!”\n",
            "   Montag reached inside the parlour wall and pulled the main switch. The images drained away, as if the water had been let out from a gigantic crystal bowl of hysterical fish.\n",
            "   The three women turned slowly and looked with unconcealed irritation and then dislike at Montag.\n",
            "   “When do you suppose the war will start?” he said. “I notice your husbands arent here tonight?”\n",
            "   “Oh, they come and go, come and go,” said Mrs. Phelps. “In again out again Finnegan, the Army called Pete yesterday. Hell be back next week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and everyone home. Thats what the Army said. Quick war. Pete was called yesterday and they said hed be, back next week. Quick...”\n",
            "   The three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty mud-coloured walls.\n",
            "   “Im not worried,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Ill let Pete do all the worrying.” She giggled. “Ill let old Pete do all the worrying. Not me. Im not worried.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” said Millie. “Let old Pete do the worrying.”\n",
            "   “Its always someone elses husband dies, they say.”\n",
            "   “Ive heard that, too. Ive never known any dead man killed in a war. Killed jumping off buildings, yes, like Glorias husband last week, but from wars? No.”\n",
            "   “Not from wars,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Anyway, Pete and I always said, no tears, nothing like that. Its our third marriage each and were independent. Be independent, we always said. He said, if I get killed off, you just go right ahead and dont cry, but get married again, and dont think of me.”\n",
            "   “That reminds me,” said Mildred. “Did you see that Clara Dove five-minute romance last night in your wall? Well, it was all about this woman who—”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but stood looking at the womens faces as he had once looked at the faces of saints in a strange church he had entered when he was a child. The faces of those enamelled creatures meant nothing to him, though he talked to them and stood in that church for a long time, trying to be of that religion, trying to know what that religion was, trying to get enough of the raw incense and special dust of the place into his lungs and thus into his blood to feel touched and concerned by the meaning of the colourful men and women with the porcelain eyes and the blood-ruby lips. But there was nothing, nothing; it was a stroll through another store, and his currency strange and unusable there, and his passion cold, even when he touched the wood and plaster and clay. So it was now, in his own parlour, with these women twisting in their chairs under his gaze, lighting cigarettes, blowing smoke, touching their sun-fired hair and examining their blazing fingernails as if they had caught fire from his look. Their faces grew haunted with silence. They leaned forward at the sound of Montags swallowing his final bite of food. They listened to his feverish breathing. The three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows of sleeping giants now, empty of dreams. Montag felt that if you touched these three staring brows you would feel a fine salt sweat on your finger-tips. The perspiration gathered with the silence and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with tension. Any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode.\n",
            "   Montag moved his lips.\n",
            "   “Lets talk.”\n",
            "   The women jerked and stared.\n",
            "   “Howre your children, Mrs. Phelps?” he asked.\n",
            "   “You know I havent any! No one in his right mind, the Good Lord knows; would have children!” said Mrs. Phelps, not quite sure why she was angry with this man.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt say that,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Ive had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and thats nice. Two Caesarians tamed the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians arent necessary; youve got the, hips for it, everythings normal, but I insisted.”\n",
            "   “Caesarians or not, children are ruinous; youre out of your mind,” said Mrs. Phelps.\n",
            "   “I plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. I put up with them when they come home three days a month; its not bad at all. You heave them into the ‘parlour’ and turn the switch. Its like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid.” Mrs. Bowles tittered. “Theyd just as soon kick as kiss me. Thank God, I can kick back!”\n",
            "   The women showed their tongues, laughing.\n",
            "   Mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that Montag was still in the doorway, clapped her hands. “Lets talk politics, to please Guy!”\n",
            "   “Sounds fine,” said Mrs. Bowles. “I voted last election, same as everyone, and I laid it on the line for President Noble. I think hes one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president.”\n",
            "   “Oh, but the man they ran against him!”\n",
            "   “He wasnt much, was he? Kind of small and homely and he didnt shave too close or comb his hair very well.”\n",
            "   “What possessed the ‘Outs’ to run him? You just dont go running a little short man like that against a tall man. Besides -he mumbled. Half the time I couldnt hear a word he said. And the words I did hear I didnt understand!”\n",
            "   “Fat, too, and didnt dress to hide it. No wonder the landslide was for Winston Noble. Even their names helped. Compare Winston Noble to Hubert Hoag for ten seconds and you can almost figure the results.”\n",
            "   “Damn it!” cried Montag. “What do you know about Hoag and Noble?”\n",
            "   “Why, they were right in that parlour wall, not six months ago. One was always picking his nose; it drove me wild.”\n",
            "   “Well, Mr. Montag,” said Mrs. Phelps, “do you want us to vote for a man like that?”\n",
            "   Mildred beamed. “You just run away from the door, Guy, and dont make us nervous.”\n",
            "   But Montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his hand.\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   “Damn it all, damn it all, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Whatve you got there; isnt that a book? I thought that all special training these days was done by film.” Mrs. Phelps blinked. “You reading up on fireman theory?”\n",
            "   “Theory, hell,” said Montag. “Its poetry.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” A whisper.\n",
            "   “Leave me alone!” Montag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum.\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on, dont...”\n",
            "   “Did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about monsters? Oh God, the way they jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their husbands and the way they talk about war, dammit, I stand here and I cant believe it!”\n",
            "   “I didnt say a single word about any war, Ill have you know,” said Mrs, Phelps.\n",
            "   “As for poetry, I hate it,” said Mrs. Bowles.\n",
            "   “Have you ever read any?”\n",
            "   “Montag,” Fabers voice scraped away at him. “Youll ruin everything. Shut up, you fool!”\n",
            "   “All three women were on their feet.\n",
            "   “Sit down!”\n",
            "   They sat.\n",
            "   “Im going home,” quavered Mrs. Bowles.\n",
            "   “Montag, Montag, please, in the name of God, what are you up to?” pleaded Faber.\n",
            "   “Why dont you just read us one of those poems from your little book,” Mrs. Phelps nodded. “I think thatd he very interesting.”\n",
            "   “Thats not right,” wailed Mrs. Bowles. “We cant do that!”\n",
            "   “Well, look at Mr. Montag, he wants to, I know he does. And if we listen nice, Mr. Montag will be happy and then maybe we can go on and do something else.” She glanced nervously at the long emptiness of the walls enclosing them.\n",
            "   “Montag, go through with this and Ill cut off, Ill leave.” The beetle jabbed his ear. “What good is this, whatll you prove?”\n",
            "   “Scare hell out of them, thats what, scare the living daylights out!”\n",
            "   Mildred looked at the empty air. “Now Guy, just who are you talking to?”\n",
            "   A silver needle pierced his brain. “Montag, listen, only one way out, play it as a joke, cover up, pretend you arent mad at all. Then-walk to your wall-incinerator, and throw the book in!”\n",
            "   Mildred had already anticipated this in a quavery voice. “Ladies, once a year, every firemans allowed to bring one book home, from the old days, to show his family how silly it all was, how nervous that sort of thing can make you, how crazy. Guys surprise tonight is to read you one sample to show how mixed-up things were, so none of us will ever have to bother our little old heads about that junk again, isnt that right, darling?”\n",
            "   He crushed the book in his fists. “Say ‘yes.’”\n",
            "   His mouth moved like Fabers.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Mildred snatched the book with a laugh. “Here! Read this one. No, I take it back. Heres that real funny one you read out loud today. Ladies, you wont understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go ahead, Guy, that page, dear.”\n",
            "   He looked at the opened page.\n",
            "   A fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. “Read.”\n",
            "   “Whats the title, dear?”\n",
            "   “Dover Beach.” His mouth was numb.\n",
            "   “Now read in a nice clear voice and go slow.”\n",
            "   The room was blazing hot, he was all fire, he was all coldness; they sat in the middle of an empty desert with three chairs and him standing, swaying, and him waiting for Mrs. Phelps to stop straightening her dress hem and Mrs. Bowles to take her fingers away from her hair. Then he began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there in the great hot emptiness:\n",
            "   “The Sea of Faith\n",
            "   Was once, too, at the full, and round earths shore\n",
            "   Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\n",
            "   But now I only hear\n",
            "   Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\n",
            "   Retreating, to the breath\n",
            "   Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\n",
            "   And naked shingles of the world.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The chairs creaked under the three women. Montag finished it out:\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Ah, love, let us be true\n",
            "   To one another! for the world, which seems\n",
            "   To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n",
            "   So various, so beautiful, so new,\n",
            "   Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n",
            "   Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\n",
            "   And we are here as on a darkling plain\n",
            "   Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\n",
            "   Where ignorant armies clash by night.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Mrs. Phelps was crying.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed itself out of shape. They sat, not touching her, bewildered by her display. She sobbed uncontrollably. Montag himself was stunned and shaken.\n",
            "   “Sh, sh,” said Mildred. “Youre all right, Clara, now, Clara, snap out of it! Clara, whats wrong?”\n",
            "   “I-I,”, sobbed Mrs. Phelps, “dont know, dont know, I just dont know, oh oh...”\n",
            "   Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. “You see? I knew it, thats what I wanted to prove! I knew it would happen! Ive always said, poetry and tears, poetry and suicide and crying and awful feelings, poetry and sickness; all that mush! Now Ive had it proved to me. Youre nasty, Mr. Montag, youre nasty!”\n",
            "   Faber said, “Now...”\n",
            "   Montag felt himself turn and walk to the wall-slot and drop the book in through the brass notch to the waiting flames.\n",
            "   “Silly words, silly words, silly awful hurting words,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Why do people want to hurt people? Not enough hurt in the world, youve got to tease people with stuff like that!”\n",
            "   “Clara, now, Clara,” begged Mildred, pulling her arm. “Come on, lets be cheery, you turn the ‘family’ on, now. Go ahead. Lets laugh and be happy, now, stop crying, well have a party!”\n",
            "   “No,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Im trotting right straight home. You want to visit my house and ‘family,’ well and good. But I wont come in this firemans crazy house again in my lifetime!”\n",
            "   “Go home.” Montag fixed his eyes upon her, quietly. “Go home and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, go home and think of the dozen abortions youve had, go home and think of that and your damn Caesarian sections, too, and your children who hate your guts! Go home and think how it all happened and what did you ever do to stop it? Go home, go home!” he yelled. “Before I knock you down and kick you out of the door!”\n",
            "   Doors slammed and the house was empty. Montag stood alone in the winter weather, with the parlour walls the colour of dirty snow.\n",
            "   In the bathroom, water ran. He heard Mildred shake the sleeping tablets into her hand.\n",
            "   “Fool, Montag, fool, fool, oh God you silly fool...”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” He pulled the green bullet from his ear and jammed it into his pocket.\n",
            "   It sizzled faintly. “...fool... fool...”\n",
            "   He searched the house and found the books where Mildred had stacked them behind the refrigerator. Some were missing and he knew that she had started on her own slow process of dispersing the dynamite in her house, stick by stick. But he was not angry now, only exhausted and bewildered with himself. He carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning.\n",
            "   He went back through the house. “Mildred?” He called at the door of the darkened bedroom. There was no sound.\n",
            "   Outside, crossing the lawn, on his way to work, he tried not to see how completely dark and deserted Clarisse McClellans house was...\n",
            "   On the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the night. Already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known Faber a lifetime. Now he knew that he was two people, that he was above all Montag, who knew nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it. And he knew that he was also the old man who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one end of the night city to the other on one long sickening gasp of motion. In the days to follow, and in the nights when there was no moon and in the nights when there was a very bright moon shining on the earth, the old man would go on with this talking and this talking, drop by drop, stone by stone, flake by flake. His mind would well over at last and he would not be Montag any more, this the old man told him, assured him, promised him. He would be Montag-plus-Faber, fire plus water, and then, one day, after everything had mixed and simmered and worked away in silence, there would be neither fire nor water, but wine. Out of two separate and opposite things, a third. And one day he would look back upon the fool and know the fool. Even now he could feel the start of the long journey, the leave-taking, the going away from the self he had been.\n",
            "   It was good listening to the beetle hum, the sleepy mosquito buzz and delicate filigree murmur of the old mans voice at first scolding him and then consoling him in the late hour of night as he emerged from the steaming subway toward the firehouse world.\n",
            "   “Pity, Montag, pity. Dont haggle and nag them; you were so recently one o f them yourself. They are so confident that they will run on for ever. But they wont run on. They dont know that this is all one huge big blazing meteor that makes a pretty fire in space, but that some day itll have to hit. They see only the blaze, the pretty fire, as you saw it.\n",
            "   “Montag, old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanut-brittle bones, have no right to criticize. Yet you almost killed things at the start. Watch it! Im with you, remember that. I understand how it happened. I must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. God, how young I felt! But now-I want you to feel old, I want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you tonight. The next few hours, when you see Captain Beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for you, let me feel the situation out. Survival is our ticket. Forget the poor, silly women...”\n",
            "   “I made them unhappier than they have been in years, Ithink,” said Montag. “It shocked me to see Mrs. Phelps cry. Maybe theyre right, maybe its best not to face things, to run, have fun. I dont know. I feel guilty—”\n",
            "   “No, you mustnt! If there were no war, if there was peace in the world, Id say fine, have fun! But, Montag, you mustnt go back to being just a fireman. All isnt well with the world.”\n",
            "   Montag perspired.\n",
            "   “Montag, you listening?”\n",
            "   “My feet,” said Montag. “I cant move them. I feel so damn silly. My feet wont move!”\n",
            "   “Listen. Easy now,” said the old man gently. “I know, I know. Youre afraid of making mistakes. Dont be. Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in peoples faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and youll never learn. Now, pick up your feet, into the firehouse with you! Were twins, were not alone any more, were not separated out in different parlours, with no contact between. If you need help when Beatty pries at you, Ill be sitting right here in your eardrum making notes!”\n",
            "   Montag felt his right foot, then his left foot, move.\n",
            "   “Old man,” he said, “stay with me.”\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound was gone. Its kennel was empty and the firehouse stood all about in plaster silence and the orange Salamander slept with its kerosene in its belly and the firethrowers crossed upon its flanks and Montag came in through the silence and touched the brass pole and slid up in the dark air, looking back at the deserted kennel, his heart beating, pausing, beating. Faber was a grey moth asleep in his ear, for the moment.\n",
            "   Beatty stood near the drop-hole waiting, but with his back turned as if he were not waiting.\n",
            "   “Well,” he said to the men playing cards, “here comes a very strange beast which in all tongues is called a fool.”\n",
            "   He put his hand to one side, palm up, for a gift. Montag put the book in it. Without even glancing at the title, Beatty tossed the book into the trash-basket and lit a cigarette. “‘Who are a little wise, the best fools be.’ Welcome back, Montag. I hope youll be staying, with us, now that your fever is done and your sickness over. Sit in for a hand of poker?”\n",
            "   They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beattys sight, Montag felt the guilt of his hands. His fingers were like ferrets that had done some evil and now never rested, always stirred and picked and hid in pockets, moving from under Beattys alcohol-flame stare. If Beatty so much as breathed on them, Montag felt that his hands might wither, turn over on their sides, and never be shocked to life again; they would be buried the rest of his life in his coat-sleeves, forgotten. For these were the hands that had acted on their own, no part of him, here was where the conscience first manifested itself to snatch books, dart off with job and Ruth and Willie Shakespeare, and now, in the firehouse, these hands seemed gloved with blood.\n",
            "   Twice in half an hour, Montag had to rise from the game and go to the latrine to wash his hands. When he came back he hid his hands under the table.\n",
            "   Beatty laughed. “Lets have your hands in sight, Montag.\n",
            "   Not that we dont trust you, understand, but—”\n",
            "   They all laughed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “the crisis is past and all is well, the sheep returns to the fold. Were all sheep who have strayed at times. Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning, weve cried. They are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts, weve shouted to ourselves. ‘Sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge,’ Sir Philip Sidney said. But on the other hand: ‘Words are like leaves and where they most abound, Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.’ Alexander Pope. What do you think of that?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Careful,” whispered Faber, living in another world, far away.\n",
            "   “Or this? ‘A little learning is a dangerous thing. Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring; There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again.’ Pope. Same Essay. Where does that put you?”\n",
            "   Montag bit his lip.\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” said Beatty, smiling at his cards. “That made you for a little while a drunkard. Read a few lines and off you go over the cliff. Bang, youre ready to blow up the world, chop off heads, knock down women and children, destroy authority. I know, Ive been through it all.”\n",
            "   “Im all right,” said Montag, nervously.\n",
            "   “Stop blushing. Im not needling, really Im not. Do you know, I had a dream an hour ago. I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said ‘Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!’ And I said, ‘Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that “He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.’” Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!”\n",
            "   “Dont listen,” whispered Faber. “Hes trying to confuse. Hes slippery. Watch out!”\n",
            "   Beatty chuckled. “And you said, quoting, ‘Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!’ And I cried in good humour, ‘Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!’ And ‘The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.’ And you yelled, ‘This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than of a threadbare saint in wisdoms school!’ And I whispered gently, ‘The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.’ And you screamed, ‘Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!’ And I said, patting your hand, ‘What, do I give you trench mouth?’ And you shrieked, ‘Knowledge is power!’ and ‘A dwarf on a giants shoulders of the furthest of the two!’ and I summed my side up with rare serenity in, ‘The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr. Valery once said.’”\n",
            "   Montags head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, “No! shut up, youre confusing things, stop it!” Beattys graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist.\n",
            "   “God, what a pulse! Ive got you going, have I, Montag. Jesus God, your pulse sounds like the day after the war. Everything but sirens and bells! Shall I talk some more? I like your look of panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I speak them all. A kind of excellent dumb discourse, Willie!”\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on!” The moth brushed Montags ear. “Hes muddying the waters!”\n",
            "   “Oh, you were scared silly,” said Beatty, “for I was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You think theyre backing you up, and they turn on you. Others can use them, too, and there you are, lost in the middle of the moor, in a great welter of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the very end of my dream, along I came with the Salamander and said, Going my way? And you got in and we drove back to the firehouse in beatific silence, all -dwindled away to peace.” Beatty let Montags wrist go, let the hand slump limply on the table. “Alls well that is well in the end.”\n",
            "   Silence. Montag sat like a carved white stone. The echo of the final hammer on his skull died slowly away into the black cavern where Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And then when the startled dust had settled down about Montags mind, Faber began, softly, “All right, hes had his say. You must take it in. Ill say my say, too, in the next few hours. And youll take it in. And youll try to judge them and make your decision as to which way to jump, or fall. But I want it to be your decision, not mine, and not the Captains. But remember that the Captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority. We all have our harps to play. And its up to you now to know with which ear youll listen.”\n",
            "   Montag opened his mouth to answer Faber and was saved this error in the presence of others when the station bell rang. The alarm-voice in the ceiling chanted. There was a tacking-tacking sound as the alarm-report telephone typed out the address across the room. Captain Beatty, his poker cards in one pink hand, walked with exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the address when the report was finished. He glanced perfunctorily at it, and shoved it in his pocket. He came back and sat down. The others looked at him.\n",
            "   “It can wait exactly forty seconds while I take all the money away from you,” said Beatty, happily.\n",
            "   Montag put his cards down.\n",
            "   “Tired, Montag? Going out of this game?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “Hold on. Well, come to think of it, we can finish this hand later. Just leave your cards face down and hustle the equipment. On the double now.” And Beatty rose up again. “Montag, you dont look well? Id hate to think you were coming down with another fever...”\n",
            "   “Ill be all right.”\n",
            "   “Youll be fine. This is a special case. Come on, jump for it!”\n",
            "   They leaped into the air and clutched the brass pole as if it were the last vantage point above a tidal wave passing below, and then the brass pole, to their dismay slid them down into darkness, into the blast and cough and suction of the gaseous dragon roaring to life!\n",
            "   “Hey!”\n",
            "   They rounded a corner in thunder and siren, with concussion of tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank, like the food in the stomach of a giant; with Montags fingers jolting off the silver rail, swinging into cold space, with the wind tearing his hair back from his head, with the wind whistling in his teeth, and him all the while thinking of the women, the chaff women in his parlour tonight, with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and his silly damned reading of a book to them. How like trying to put out fires with water-pistols, how senseless and insane. One rage turned in for another. One anger displacing another. When would he stop being entirely mad and be quiet, be very quiet indeed?\n",
            "   “Here we go!”\n",
            "   Montag looked up. Beatty never drove, but he was driving tonight, slamming the Salamander around corners, leaning forward high on the drivers throne, his massive black slicker flapping out behind so that he seemed a great black bat flying above the engine, over the brass numbers, taking the full wind.\n",
            "   “Here we go to keep the world happy, Montag!”\n",
            "   Beattys pink, phosphorescent cheeks glimmered in the high darkness, and he was smiling furiously.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The Salamander boomed to a halt, throwing men off in slips and clumsy hops. Montag stood fixing his raw eyes to the cold bright rail under his clenched fingers.\n",
            "   I cant do it, he thought. How can I go at this new assignment, how can I go on burning things? I cant go in this place.\n",
            "   Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had rushed, was at Montags elbow. “All right, Montag?”\n",
            "   The men ran like cripples in their clumsy boots, as quietly as spiders.\n",
            "   At last Montag raised his eyes and turned. Beatty was watching his face.\n",
            "   “Something the matter, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Why,” said Montag slowly, “weve stopped in front of my house.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   \n",
            "PART III\n",
            "BURNING BRIGHT\n",
            "\n",
            "   LIGHTS flicked on and house-doors opened all down the street, to watch the carnival set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with dry satisfaction, the other with disbelief, at the house before them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “now you did it. Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that hes burnt his damn wings, he wonders why. Didnt I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?”\n",
            "   Montags face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door, set in its bright borders of flowers.\n",
            "   Beatty snorted. “Oh, no! You werent fooled by that little idiots routine, now, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! Its all in her file. Ill be damned. Ive hit the bullseye. Look at the sick look on your face. A few grass-blades and the quarters of the moon. What trash. What good did she ever do with all that?”\n",
            "   Montag sat on the cold fender of the Dragon, moving his head half an inch to the left, half an inch to the right, left, right, left right, left...\n",
            "   “She saw everything. She didnt do anything to anyone. She just let them alone.”\n",
            "   “Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didnt she? One of those damn do-gooders with their shocked, holier-than-thou silences, their one talent making others feel guilty. God damn, they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed!”\n",
            "   The front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, running, one suitcase held with a dream-like clenching rigidity in her fist, as a beetle-taxi hissed to the curb.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick.\n",
            "   “Mildred, you didnt put in the alarm!”\n",
            "   She shoved the valise in the waiting beetle, climbed in, and sat mumbling, “Poor family, poor family, oh everything gone, everything, everything gone now...”\n",
            "   Beatty grabbed Montags shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour, far down the street, gone.\n",
            "   There was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms. Montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him, to see Stoneman and Black wielding axes, shattering window-panes to provide cross-ventilation.\n",
            "   The brush of a deaths-head moth against a cold black screen. “Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What is happening\n",
            "   “This is happening to me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What a dreadful surprise,” said Beatty. “For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are. But lets not talk about them, eh? By the time the consequences catch up with you, its too late, isnt it, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Montag, can you get away, run?” asked Faber.\n",
            "   Montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses. Beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze.\n",
            "   “What is there about fire thats so lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” Beatty blew out the flame and lit it again. “Its perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or almost perpetual motion. If you let it go on, itd burn our lifetimes out. What is fire? Its a mystery. Scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules. But they dont really know. Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets too burdensome, then into the furnace with it. Now, Montag, youre a burden. And fire will lift you off my shoulders, clean, quick, sure; nothing to rot later. Antibiotic, aesthetic, practical.”\n",
            "   Montag stood looking in now at this queer house, made strange by the hour of the night, by murmuring neighbour voices, by littered glass, and there on the floor, their covers torn off and spilled out like swan-feathers, the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth bothering with, for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper, and ravelled binding.\n",
            "   Mildred, of course. She must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them back in. Mildred. Mildred.\n",
            "   “I want you to do this job all by your lonesome, Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your house, your clean-up.”\n",
            "   “Montag, cant you run, get away!”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Montag helplessly. “The Hound! Because of the Hound!”\n",
            "   Faber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was meant for him, heard. “Yes, the Hounds somewhere about the neighbourhood, so dont try anything. Ready?”\n",
            "   “Ready.” Montag snapped the safety-catch on the flamethrower.\n",
            "   “Fire!”\n",
            "   A great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall. He stepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering whisper, with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain. He burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything, the chairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the silverware and plastic dishes, everything that showed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him tomorrow, who had gone and quite forgotten him already, listening to her Seashell radio pour in on her and in on her as she rode across town, alone. And as before, it was good to burn, he felt himself gush out in the fire, snatch, rend, rip in half with flame, and put away the senseless problem. If there was no solution, well then now there was no problem, either. Fire was best for everything!\n",
            "   “The books, Montag!”\n",
            "   The books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers.\n",
            "   And then he came to the parlour where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white thoughts and their snowy dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the vacuum hissed out at him. The emptiness made an even emptier whistle, a senseless scream. He tried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed, but he could not. He held his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs. He cut off its terrible emptiness, drew back, and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning. The fire-proof plastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame.\n",
            "   “When youre quite finished,” said Beatty behind him. “Youre under arrest.”\n",
            "   The house fell in red coals and black ash. It bedded itself down in sleepy pink-grey cinders and a smoke plume blew over it, rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky. It was three-thirty in the morning. The crowd drew back into the houses; the great tents of the circus had slumped into charcoal and rubble and the show was well over.\n",
            "   Montag stood with the flame-thrower in his limp hands, great islands of perspiration drenching his armpits, his face smeared with soot. The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces illuminated faintly by the smouldering foundation.\n",
            "   Montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together.\n",
            "   “Was it my wife turned in the alarm?”\n",
            "   Beatty nodded. “But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I let ride. One way or the other, youd have got it. It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly damn snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks hes the Lord of all Creation. You think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger, youll drown!”\n",
            "   Montag could not move. A great earthquake had come with fire and levelled the house and Mildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move. The earthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there, his knees half-bent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage, letting Beatty hit him without raising a hand.\n",
            "   “Montag, you idiot, Montag, you damn fool; why did you really do it?”\n",
            "   Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was running with his mind, he was gone, leaving this dead soot-covered body to sway in front of another raving fool.\n",
            "   “Montag, get out of there!” said Faber.\n",
            "   Montag listened.\n",
            "   Beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back. The green bullet in which Fabers voice whispered and cried, fell to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He held it half in, half out of his ear.\n",
            "   Montag heard the distant voice calling, “Montag, you all right?”\n",
            "   Beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket. “Well—so theres more here than I thought. I saw you tilt your head, listening. First I thought you had a Seashell. But when you turned clever later, I wondered. Well trace this and drop it on your friend.”\n",
            "   “No!” said Montag.\n",
            "   He twitched the safety catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montags fingers and his eyes widened the faintest bit. Montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his hands to see what new thing they had done. Thinking back later he could never decide whether the hands or Beattys reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder. The last rolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears, not touching him.\n",
            "   Beatty grinned his most charming grin. “Well, thats one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. Whatll it be this time? Why dont you belch Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? ‘There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind, which I respect not!’ Hows that? Go ahead now, you second-hand litterateur, pull the trigger.” He took one step toward Montag.\n",
            "   Montag only said, “We never burned right...”\n",
            "   “Hand it over, Guy,” said Beatty with a fixed smile.\n",
            "   And then he was a shrieking blaze, a jumping, sprawling, gibbering mannikin, no longer human or known, all writhing flame on the lawn as Montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on him. There was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove, a bubbling and frothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction and a boiling over of yellow foam. Montag shut his eyes, shouted, shouted, and fought to get his hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and at last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent.\n",
            "   The other two firemen did not move.\n",
            "   Montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flame-thrower. “Turn around!”\n",
            "   They turned, their faces like blanched meat, streaming sweat; he beat their heads, knocking off their helmets and bringing them down on themselves. They fell and lay without moving.\n",
            "   The blowing of a single autumn leaf.\n",
            "   He turned and the Mechanical Hound was there.\n",
            "   It was half across the lawn, coming from the shadows, moving with such drifting ease that it was like a single solid cloud of black-grey smoke blown at him in silence.\n",
            "   It made a single last leap into the air, coming down at Montag from a good three feet over his head, its spidered legs reaching, the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth. Montag caught it with a bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten feet back against the bole of a tree, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it scrabble and seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the Hound up in the air, burst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour like a skyrocket fastened to the street. Montag lay watching the dead-alive thing fiddle the air and die. Even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now working through the flesh of his leg. He felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles an hour. He was afraid to\n",
            "   get up, afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all, with an anaesthetized leg. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness...\n",
            "   And now...?\n",
            "   The street empty, the house burnt like an ancient bit of stage-scenery, the other homes dark, the Hound here, Beatty there, the three other firemen another place, and the Salamander...? He gazed at the immense engine. That would have to go, too.\n",
            "   Well, he thought, lets see how badly off you are. On your feet now. Easy, easy... there.\n",
            "   He stood and he had only one leg. The other was like a chunk of burnt pine-log he was carrying along as a penance for some obscure sin. When he put his weight on it, a shower of silver needles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on, you, you cant stay here!\n",
            "   A few house-lights were going on again down the street, whether from the incidents just passed, or because of the abnormal silence following the fight, Montag did not know. He hobbled around the ruins, seizing at his bad leg when it lagged, talking and whimpering and shouting directions at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital. He heard a number of people crying out in the darkness and shouting. He reached the back yard and the alley. Beatty, he thought, youre not a problem now. You always said, dont face a problem, bum it. Well, now Ive done both. Good-bye, Captain.\n",
            "   And he stumbled along the alley in the dark.\n",
            "   A shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought, youre a fool, a damn fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful idiot, a damn idiot, and a fool, a damn fool; look at the mess and wheres the mop, look at the mess, and what do you do? Pride, damn it, and temper, and youve junked it all, at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself. But everything at once, but everything one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, everything. No excuse, though, no excuse. A fool, a damn fool, go give yourself up!\n",
            "   No, well save what we can, well do what there is left to do. If we have to burn, lets take a few more with us. Here!\n",
            "   He remembered the books and turned back. Just on the off chance.\n",
            "   He found a few books where he had left them, near the garden fence. Mildred, God bless her, had missed a few. Four books still lay hidden where he had put them. Voices were wailing in the night and flashbeams swirled about. Other Salamanders were roaring their engines far away, and police sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens.\n",
            "   Montag took the four remaining books and hopped, jolted, hopped his way down the alley and suddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there. Something inside had jerked him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay where he had fallen and sobbed, his legs folded, his face pressed blindly to the gravel.\n",
            "   Beatty wanted to die.\n",
            "   In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there, joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air. How strange, strange, to want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and staying alive, you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad, and then...\n",
            "   At a distance, running feet.\n",
            "   Montag sat up. Lets get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just cant sit! But he was still crying and that had to be finished. It was going away now. He hadnt wanted to kill anyone, not even Beatty. His flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He saw Beatty, a torch, not moving, fluttering out on the grass. He bit at his knuckles. Im sorry, Im sorry, oh God, sorry...\n",
            "   He tried to piece it all together, to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago before the sieve and the sand, Denhams Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and excursions, too much for a few short days, too much, indeed, for a lifetime.\n",
            "   Feet ran in the far end of the alley.\n",
            "   “Get up!” he told himself. “Damn it, get up!” he said to the leg, and stood. The pains were spikes driven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common, ordinary safety pins, and after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps, filling his hand with slivers from the board fence, the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg. And the leg was at last his own leg again. He had been afraid that running might break the loose ankle. Now, sucking all the night into his open mouth, and blowing it out pale, with all the blackness left heavily inside himself, he set out in a steady jogging pace. He carried the books in his hands.\n",
            "   He thought of Faber.\n",
            "   Faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now. He had burnt Faber, too. He felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt Faber was really dead, baked like a roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.\n",
            "   You must remember, burn them or theyll burn you, he thought. Right now its as simple as that.\n",
            "   He searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other pocket he found the usual Seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning.\n",
            "   “Police Alert. Wanted: Fugitive in city. Has committed murder and crimes against the State. Name: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. Last seen...”\n",
            "   He ran steadily for six blocks, in the alley, and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty thoroughfare ten lanes wide. It seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open. It was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him to run across, easily seen in the blazing illumination, easily caught, easily shot down.\n",
            "   The Seashell hummed in his ear.\n",
            "   “...watch for a man running...watch for the running man... watch for a man alone, on foot... watch...”\n",
            "   Montag pulled back into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas station, a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there, and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up. Now he must be clean and presentable if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly across that wide boulevard. It would give him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to get where...?\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, where am I running?\n",
            "   Nowhere. There was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really. Except Faber. And then he realized that he was indeed, running toward Fabers house, instinctively. But Faber couldnt hide him; it would be suicide even to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway, for a few short minutes. Fabers would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in his own ability to survive. He just wanted to know that there was a man like Faber in the world. He wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body. And some of the money must be left with Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on his way. Perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the highways, in the fields and hills.\n",
            "   A great whirling whisper made him look to the sky.\n",
            "   The police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head off a dry dandelion flower. Two dozen of them flurried, wavering, indecisive, three miles off, like butterflies puzzled by autumn, and then they were plummeting down to land, one by one, here, there, softly kneading the streets where, turned back to beetles, they shrieked along the boulevards or, as suddenly, leapt back into the sir, continuing their search.\n",
            "   And here was the gas station, its attendants busy now with customers. Approaching from the rear, Montag entered the mens washroom. Through the aluminium wall he heard a radio voice saying, “War has been declared.” The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines, the gas, the money owed. Montag stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing would happen. The war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file, an hour, two hours from now.\n",
            "   He washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry, making little sound. He came out of the washroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the edge of the empty boulevard.\n",
            "   There it lay, a game for him to win, a vast bowling alley in the cool morning. The boulevard was as clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims and certain unknown killers. The air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the warmth of Montags body alone; it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it. And now he must begin his little walk.\n",
            "   Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep breath. His lungs were like burning brooms in his chest. His mouth was sucked dry from running. His throat tasted of bloody iron and there was rusted steel in his feet.\n",
            "   What about those lights there? Once you started walking youd have to gauge how fast those beetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the other curb? It seemed like a hundred yards. Probably not a hundred, but figure for that anyway, figure that with him going very slowly, at a nice stroll, it might take as much as thirty seconds, forty seconds to walk all the way. The beetles? Once started, they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds. So, even if halfway across he started to run...?\n",
            "   He put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right. He walked on the empty avenue.\n",
            "   Even if the street were entirely empty, of course, you couldnt be sure of a safe crossing, for a car could appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had taken a dozen breaths.\n",
            "   He decided not to count his steps. He looked neither to left nor right. The light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot.\n",
            "   He listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right. Its movable headlights jerked back and forth suddenly, and caught at Montag.\n",
            "   Keep going.\n",
            "   Montag faltered, got a grip on the books, and forced himself not to freeze. Instinctively he took a few quick, running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again. He was now half across the street, but the roar from the beetles engines whined higher as it put on speed.\n",
            "   The police, of course. They see me. But slow now; slow, quiet, dont turn, dont look, dont seem concerned. Walk, thats it, walls, walk.\n",
            "   The beetle was rushing. The beetle was roaring. The beetle raised its speed. The beetle was whining. The beetle was in high thunder. The beetle came skimming. The beetle came in a single whistling trajectory, fired from an invisible rifle. It was up to 120 m. p. h. It was up to 130 at least. Montag clamped his jaws. The heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks, it seemed, and jittered his eye-lids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body.\n",
            "   He began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran. He put out his legs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and down and back. God! God! He dropped a book, broke pace, almost turned, changed his mind, plunged on, yelling in concrete emptiness, the beetle scuttling after its running food, two hundred, one hundred feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag gasping, flailing his hands, legs up down out, up down out, closer, closer, hooting, calling, his eyes burnt white now as his head jerked about to confront the flashing glare, now the beetle was swallowed in its own light, now it was nothing but a torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. Now-almost on top of him!\n",
            "   He stumbled and fell.\n",
            "   Im done! Its over!\n",
            "   But the falling made a difference. An instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and swerved out. It was gone. Montag lay flat, his head down. Wisps of laughter trailed back to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle.\n",
            "   His right hand was extended above him, flat. Across the extreme tip of his middle finger, he saw now as he lifted that hand, a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tyre had touched in passing. He looked at that black line with disbelief, getting to his feet.\n",
            "   That wasnt the police, he thought.\n",
            "   He looked down the boulevard. It was clear now. A carful of children, all ages, God knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling, yelling, hurrahing, had seen a man, a very extraordinary sight, a man strolling, a rarity, and simply said, “Lets get him,” not knowing he was the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a,number of children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours, their faces icy with wind, and coming home or not coming at dawn, alive or not alive, that made the adventure.\n",
            "   They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek. For no reason at all in the world they would have killed me.\n",
            "   He walked toward the far kerb telling each foot to go and keep going. Somehow he had picked up the spilled books; he didnt remember bending or touching them. He kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse?\n",
            "   He stopped and his mind said it again, very loud.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse!\n",
            "   He wanted to run after them yelling.\n",
            "   His eyes watered.\n",
            "   The thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that car, seeing Montag down, instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out. If Montag had remained an upright target...?\n",
            "   Montag gasped.\n",
            "   Far down the boulevard, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and was now racing back, slanting over on the wrong side of the street, picking up speed.\n",
            "   But Montag was gone, hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long journey, an hour or was it a minute, ago? He stood shivering in the night, looking back out as the beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue, whirling laughter in the air all about it, gone.\n",
            "   Further on, as Montag moved in darkness, he could see the helicopters falling, falling, like the first flakes of snow in the long winter. to come...\n",
            "   The house was silent.\n",
            "   Montag approached from the rear, creeping through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass. He touched the screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved across the porch, listening.\n",
            "   Mrs. Black, are you asleep in there? he thought. This isnt good, but your husband did it to others and never asked and never wondered and never worried. And now since youre a firemans wife, its your house and your turn, for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt without thinking..\n",
            "   The house did not reply.\n",
            "   He hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back and the house was still dark and quiet, sleeping.\n",
            "   On his way across town, with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky, he phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night. Then he stood in the cold night air, waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders coming, coming to bum Mr. Blacks house while he was away at work, to make his wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire. But now, she was still asleep.\n",
            "   Good night, Mrs. Black, he thought.—\n",
            "   “Faber!”\n",
            "   Another rap, a whisper, and a long waiting. Then, after a minute, a small light flickered inside Fabers small house. After another pause, the back door opened.\n",
            "   They stood looking at each other in the half-light, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in the others existence. Then Faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed Montag and moved him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were wailing off in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Ive been a fool all down the line. I cant stay long. Im on my way God knows where.”\n",
            "   “At least you were a fool about the right things,” said Faber. “I thought you were dead. The audio-capsule I gave you—”\n",
            "   “Burnt.”\n",
            "   “I heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing. I almost came out looking for you.”\n",
            "   “The captains dead. He found the audio-capsule, he heard your voice, he was going to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower.”\n",
            "   Faber sat down and did not speak for a time.\n",
            "   “My God, how did this happen?” said Montag. “It was only the other night everything was fine and the next thing I know Im drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I cant breathe. Theres Beatty dead, and he was my friend once, and theres Millie gone, I thought she was my wife, but now I dont know. And the house all burnt. And my job gone and myself on the run, and I planted a book in a firemans house on the way. Good Christ, the things Ive done in a single week!”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. It was coming on for a long time.”\n",
            "   “Yes, I believe that, if theres nothing else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could feel it for a long time, I was saving something up, I went around doing one thing and feeling another. God, it was all there. Its a wonder it didnt show on me, like fat. And now here I am, messing up your life. They might follow me here.”\n",
            "   “I feel alive for the first time in years,” said Faber. “I feel Im doing what I should have done a lifetime ago. For a little while Im not afraid. Maybe its because Im doing the right thing at last. Maybe its because Ive done a rash thing and dont want to look the coward to you. I suppose Ill have to do even more violent things, exposing myself so I wont fall down on the job and turn scared again. What are your plans?”\n",
            "   “To keep running.”\n",
            "   “You know the wars on?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   “God, isnt it funny?” said the old man. “It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.”\n",
            "   “I havent had time to think.” Montag drew out a hundred dollars. “I want this to stay with you, use it any way thatll help when Im gone.”\n",
            "   “But—”\n",
            "   “I might be dead by noon; use this.”\n",
            "   Faber nodded. “Youd better head for the river if you can, follow along it, and if you can hit the old railroad lines going out into the country, follow them. Even though practically everythings airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the rails are still there, rusting. Ive heard there are still hobo camps all across the country, here and there; walking camps they call them, and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled, they say theres lots of old Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are wanted and hunted in the cities. They survive, I guess. There arent many of them, and I guess the Governments never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down. You might hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in St. Louis, Im leaving on the five a. m. bus this morning, to see a retired printer there, Im getting out into the open myself, at last. The money will be put to good use. Thanks and God bless you. Do you want to sleep a few minutes?”\n",
            "   “Id better run.”\n",
            "   “Lets check.”\n",
            "   He took Montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside, revealing a television screen the size of a postal card. “I always wanted something very small, something I could talk to, something I could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary, nothing that could shout me down, nothing monstrous big. So, you see.” He snapped it on. “Montag,” the TV set said, and lit up. “M-O-N-T-A-G.” The name was spelled out by the voice. “Guy Montag. Still running. Police helicopters are up. A new Mechanical Hound has been brought from another district...”\n",
            "   Montag and Faber looked at each other.\n",
            "   “...Mechanical Hound never fails. Never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible invention made a mistake. Tonight, this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the Hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target...”\n",
            "   Faber poured two glasses of whisky. “Well need these.”\n",
            "   They drank.\n",
            "   “...nose so sensitive the Mechanical Hound can remember and identify ten thousand odour-indexes on ten thousand men without re-setting!”\n",
            "   Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house, at the walls, the door, the doorknob, and the chair where Montag now sat. Montag saw the look. They both looked quickly about the house and Montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the sweat of his hand hung from the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the jewels of a small chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about everything, he was a luminous cloud, a ghost that made breathing once more impossible. He saw Faber stop up his own breath for fear of drawing that ghost into his own body, perhaps, being contaminated with the phantom exhalations and odours of a running man.\n",
            "   “The Mechanical Hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the Burning!”\n",
            "   And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd, and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower.\n",
            "   So they must have their game out, thought Montag. The circus must go on, even with war beginning within the hour...\n",
            "   He watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed so remote and no part of him; it was a play apart and separate, wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. Thats all for me, you thought, thats all taking place just for me, by God.\n",
            "   If he wished, he could linger here, in comfort, and follow the entire hunt on through its swift. phases, down alleys across streets, over empty running avenues, crossing lots and playgrounds, with pauses here or there for the necessary commercials, up other alleys to the burning house of Mr. and Mrs. Black, and so on finally to this house with Faber and himself seated, drinking, while the Electric Hound snuffed down the last trail, silent as a drift of death itself, skidded to a halt outside that window there. Then, if he wished, Montag might rise, walk to the window, keep one eye on the TV screen, open the window, lean out, look back, and see himself dramatized, described, made over, standing there, limned in the bright small television screen from outside, a drama to be watched objectively, knowing that in other parlours he was large as life, in full colour, dimensionally perfect! And if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself, an instant before oblivion, being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlour-sitters who had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their living-room walls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man carnival.\n",
            "   Would he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty million people, mightnt he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would stay with them long after the. Hound had turned, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera remained stationary, watching the creature dwindle in the distance—a splendid fade-out! What could he say in a single word, a few words, that would sear all their faces and wake them up?\n",
            "   “There,” whispered Faber.\n",
            "   Out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine, not animal, not dead, not alive, glowing with a pale green luminosity. It stood near the smoking ruins of Montags house and the men brought his discarded flame-thrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the Hound. There was a whirring, clicking, humming.\n",
            "   Montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink. “Its time. Im sorry about this:”\n",
            "   “About what? Me? My house? I deserve everything. Run, for Gods sake. Perhaps I can delay them here—”\n",
            "   “Wait. Theres no use your being discovered. When I leave, burn the spread of this bed, that I touched. Burn the chair in the living room, in your wall incinerator. Wipe down the furniture with alcohol, wipe the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning on full in all the rooms and spray with moth-spray if you have it. Then, turn on your lawn sprinklers as high as theyll go and hose off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the trail in here, anyway..\n",
            "   Faber shook his hand. “Ill tend to it. Good luck. If were both in good health, next week, the week after, get in touch. General Delivery, St. Louis. Im sorry theres no way I can go with you this time, by ear-phone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I never thought I would use it. What a silly old man. No thought there. Stupid, stupid. So I havent another green bullet, the right kind, to put in your head. Go now!”\n",
            "   “One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, some old sneakers and socks...”\n",
            "   Faber was gone and back in a minute. They sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape. “To keep the ancient odour of Mr. Faber in, of course,” said Faber sweating at the job.\n",
            "   Montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky. “I dont want that Hound picking up two odours at once. May I take this whisky. Ill need it later. Christ I hope this works!”\n",
            "   They shook hands again and, going out of the door, they glanced at the TV. The Hound was on its way, followed by hovering helicopter cameras, silently, silently, sniffing the great night wind. It was running down the first alley.\n",
            "   “Good-bye!”\n",
            "   And Montag was out the back door lightly, running with the half-empty valise. Behind him he heard the lawn-sprinkling system jump up, filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then with a steady pour all about, washing on the sidewalks, and draining into the alley. He carried a few drops of this rain with him on his face. He thought he heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasnt certain.\n",
            "   He ran very fast away from the house, down toward the river.\n",
            "   Montag ran.\n",
            "   He could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and swift, like a wind that didnt stir grass, that didnt jar windows or disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Hound did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it, so you could feel the silence building up a pressure behind you all across town. Montag felt the pressure rising, and ran.\n",
            "   He stopped for breath, on his way to the river, to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened houses, and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlour walls and there on the walls the Mechanical Hound, a breath of neon vapour, spidered along, here and gone, here and gone! Now at Elm Terrace, Lincoln, Oak, Park, and up the alley toward Fabers house.\n",
            "   Go past, thought Montag, dont stop, go on, dont turn in!\n",
            "   On the parlour wall, Fabers house, with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air.\n",
            "   The Hound paused, quivering.\n",
            "   No! Montag held to the window sill. This way! Here!\n",
            "   The procaine needle flicked out and in, out and in. A single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell from the needle as it vanished in the Hounds muzzle.\n",
            "   Montag held his breath, like a doubled fist, in his chest.\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound turned and plunged away from Fabers house down the alley again.\n",
            "   Montag snapped his gaze to the sky. The helicopters were closer, a great blowing of insects to a single light source.\n",
            "   With an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.\n",
            "   He shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window, and the fascinating seance going on in there! Hell! and he was away and gone! The alley, a street, the alley, a street, and the smell of the river. Leg out, leg down, leg out and down. Twenty million Montags running, soon, if the cameras caught him. Twenty million Montags running, running like an ancient flickery Keystone Comedy, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had seen it a thousand times. Behind him now twenty million silently baying Hounds ricocheted across parlours, three-cushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall, gone, right wall, centre wall, left wall, gone!\n",
            "   Montag jammed his Seashell to his ear.\n",
            "   “Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the next minute looks from his house. Ready!”\n",
            "   Of course! Why hadnt they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadnt this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldnt be missed! The only man running alone in the night city, the only man proving his legs!\n",
            "   “At the count of ten now! One! Two!”\n",
            "   He felt the city rise. Three .\n",
            "   He felt the city turn to its thousands of doors.\n",
            "   Faster! Leg up, leg down!\n",
            "   “Four!”\n",
            "   The people sleepwalking in their hallways.\n",
            "   “Five!”\n",
            "   He felt their hands on the doorknobs!\n",
            "   The smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain. His throat was burnt rust and his eyes were wept dry with running. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last hundred yards.\n",
            "   “Six, seven, eight!”\n",
            "   The doorknobs turned on five thousand doors. “Nine!”\n",
            "   He ran out away from the last row of houses, on a slope leading down to a solid moving blackness. “Ten!”\n",
            "   The doors opened.\n",
            "   He imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards, into alleys, and into the sky, faces hid by curtains, pale, night-frightened faces, like grey animals peering from electric caves, faces with grey colourless eyes, grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb flesh of the face.\n",
            "   But he was at the river.\n",
            "   He touched it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin, splashed his body, arms, legs, and head with raw liquor; drank it and snuffed some up his nose. Then he dressed in Fabers old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river and watched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the dark.\n",
            "   He was three hundred yards downstream when the Hound reached the river. Overhead the great racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light fell upon the river and Montag dived under the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds. He felt the river pull him further on its way, into darkness. Then the lights switched back to the land, the helicopters swerved over the city again, as if they had picked up another trail. They were gone. The Hound was gone. Now there was only the cold river and Montag floating in a sudden peacefulness, away from the city and the lights and the chase, away from everything.\n",
            "   He felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors. He felt as if he had left the great seance and all the murmuring ghosts. He was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a reality that was unreal because it was new.\n",
            "   The black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.\n",
            "   He floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper. The river was very real; it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last, the leisure, to consider this month, this year, and a lifetime of years. He listened to his heart slow. His thoughts stopped rushing with his blood.\n",
            "   He saw the moon low in the sky now. The moon there, and the light of the moon caused by what? By the sun, of course. And what lights the sun? Its own fire. And the sun goes on, day after day, burning and burning. The sun and time. The sun and time and burning. Burning. The river bobbled him along gently. Burning. The sun and every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a single thing in his mind. After a long time of floating on the land and a short time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life.\n",
            "   The sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant. that everything burned!\n",
            "   One of them had to stop burning. The sun wouldnt, certainly. So it looked as if it had to be Montag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago. Somewhere the saving and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one way or another, in books, in records, in peoples heads, any way at all so long as it was safe, free from moths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and men with matches. The world was full of burning of all types and sizes. Now the guild of the asbestos-weaver must open shop very soon.\n",
            "   He felt his heel bump land, touch pebbles and rocks, scrape sand. The river had moved him toward shore.\n",
            "   He looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light, without shape, with only a size that went a thousand miles without wanting to stop, with its grass hills and forests that were waiting for him.\n",
            "   He hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water. He expected the Hound there. Suddenly the trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters.\n",
            "   But there was only the normal autumn wind high up, going by like another river. Why wasnt the Hound running? Why had the search veered inland? Montag listened. Nothing. Nothing.\n",
            "   Millie, he thought. All this country here. Listen to it! Nothing and nothing. So much silence, Millie, I wonder how youd take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad.\n",
            "   Millie was not here and the Hound was not here, but the dry smell of hay blowing from some distant field put Montag on the land. He remembered a farm he had visited when he was very young, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of unreality, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the tin moat of the city, cows chewed grass and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill.\n",
            "   Now, the dry smell of hay, the motion of the waters, made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a lonely barn away from the loud highways, behind a quiet farmhouse, and under an ancient windmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead. He lay in the high barn loft all night, listening to distant animals and insects and trees, the little motions and stirrings.\n",
            "   During the night, he thought, below the loft, he would hear a sound like feet moving, perhaps. He would tense and sit up. The sound would move away, He would lie back and look out of the loft window, very late in the night, and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself, until a very young and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to see her, but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now, so very long ago, the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin. Then, she would be gone from the warm window and appear again upstairs in her moon-whitened room. And then, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon, he would lie in the loft, hidden and safe, watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth, fleeing from the soft colour of dawn.\n",
            "   In the morning he would not have needed sleep, for all the warm odours and sights of a complete country night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth, when he thought to test it, was half a smile.\n",
            "   And there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, waiting for him, would be the incredible thing. He would step carefully down, in the pink light of early morning, so fully aware of the world that he would be afraid, and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it.\n",
            "   A cool glass of fresh milk, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps.\n",
            "   This was all he wanted now. Some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him the long time needed to think all the things that must be thought.\n",
            "   A glass of milk, an apple, a pear.\n",
            "   He stepped from the river.\n",
            "   The land rushed at him, a tidal wave. He was crushed by darkness and the look of the country and the million odours on a wind that iced his body. He fell back under the breaking curve of darkness and sound and smell, his ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over his sight like flaming meteors. He wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down somewhere. This dark land rising was like that day in his childhood, swimming, when from nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and green darkness, water burning mouth and nose, retching his stomach, screaming! Too much water!\n",
            "   Too much land!\n",
            "   Out of the black wall before him, a whisper. A shape. In the shape, two eyes. The night looking at him. The forest, seeing him.\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   After all the running and rushing and sweating it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work this hard, and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find...\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   Montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man.\n",
            "   The shape exploded away. The eyes vanished. The leafpiles flew up in a dry shower.\n",
            "   Montag was alone in the wilderness.\n",
            "   A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-like perfume mingled with blood and the gummed exhalation of the animals breath, all cardamon and moss and ragweed odour in this huge night where the trees ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the pulse of the heart behind his eyes.\n",
            "   There must have been a billion leaves on the land; he waded in them, a dry river smelling of hot cloves and warm dust. And the other smells! There was a smell like a cut potato from all the land, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. There was a smell like pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home. There was a faint yellow odour like mustard from a jar. There was a smell like carnations from the yard next door. He put down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him. His fingers smelled of liquorice.\n",
            "   He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was filled up with all the details of the land. He was not empty. There was more than enough here to fill him. There would always be more than enough.\n",
            "   He walked in the shallow tide of leaves, stumbling.\n",
            "   And in the middle of the strangeness, a familiarity.\n",
            "   His foot hit something that rang dully.\n",
            "   He moved his hand on the ground, a yard this way, a yard that.\n",
            "   The railroad track.\n",
            "   The track that came out of the city and rusted across the land, through forests and woods, deserted now, by the river.\n",
            "   Here was the path to wherever he was going. Here was the single familiar thing, the magic charm he might need a little while, to touch, to feel beneath his feet, as he moved on into the bramble bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the blowing down of leaves.\n",
            "   He walked on the track.\n",
            "   And he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove.\n",
            "   Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking now.\n",
            "   Half an hour later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware of his entire body, his face, his mouth, his eyes stuffed with blackness, his ears stuffed with sound, his legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he saw the fire ahead.\n",
            "   The fire was gone, then back again, like a winking eye. He stopped, afraid he might blow the fire out with a single breath. But the fire was there and he approached warily, from a long way off. It took the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it, and then he stood looking at it from cover. That small motion, the white and red colour, a strange fire because it meant a different thing to him.\n",
            "   It was not burning; it was warming!\n",
            "   He saw many hands held to its warmth, hands without arms, hidden in darkness. Above the hands, motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight. He hadnt known fire could look this way. He had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take. Even its smell was different.\n",
            "   How long he stood he did not know, but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing himself as an animal come from the forest, drawn by the fire. He was a thing of brush and liquid eye, of fur and muzzle and hoof, he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long long time, listening to the warm crackle of the flames.\n",
            "   There was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the mens faces, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn it over with the eyes, as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of steel these men were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the silence. Montag moved toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world.\n",
            "   And then the voices began and they were talking, and he could hear nothing of what the voices said, but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking at it; the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river. The voices talked of everything, there was nothing they could not talk about, he knew from the very cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them.\n",
            "   And then one of the men looked up and saw him, for the first or perhaps the seventh time, and a voice called to Montag:\n",
            "   “All right, you can come out now!”\n",
            "   Montag stepped back into the shadows.\n",
            "   “Its all right,” the voice said. “Youre welcome here.”\n",
            "   Montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits. He did not know what to say to them.\n",
            "   “Sit down,” said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group. “Have some coffee?”\n",
            "   He watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity. His lips were scalded, but that was good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat, and their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down again. Montag sipped. “Thanks,” he said. “Thanks very much.”\n",
            "   “Youre welcome, Montag. My names Granger.” He held out a small bottle of colourless fluid. “Drink this, too. Itll change the chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now youll smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the best thing is Bottoms up.”\n",
            "   Montag drank the bitter fluid.\n",
            "   “Youll stink like a bobcat, but thats all right,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “You know my name;” said Montag.\n",
            "   Granger nodded to a portable battery TV set by the fire.\n",
            "   “Weve watched the chase. Figured youd wind up south along the river. When we heard you plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk, we didnt hide as we usually do. We figured you were in the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city. Something funny there. The chase is still running. The other way, though.”\n",
            "   “The other way?”\n",
            "   “Lets have a look.”\n",
            "   Granger snapped the portable viewer on. The picture was a nightmare, condensed, easily passed from hand to hand, in the forest, all whirring colour and flight. A voice cried:\n",
            "   “The chase continues north in the city! Police helicopters are converging on Avenue 87 and Elm Grove Park!”\n",
            "   Granger nodded. “Theyre faking. You threw them off at the river. They cant admit it. They know they can hold their audience only so long. The shows got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So theyre sniffing for a scape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. Theyll catch Montag in the next five minutes!”\n",
            "   “But how—”\n",
            "   “Watch.”\n",
            "   The camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street.\n",
            "   “See that?” whispered Granger. “Itll be you; right up at the end of that street is our victim. See how our camera is coming in? Building the scene. Suspense. Long shot. Right now, some poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Dont think the police dont know the habits of queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia Anyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. Never know when that sort of information might be handy. And today, it turns out, its very usable indeed. It saves face. Oh, God, look there!”\n",
            "   The men at the fire bent forward.\n",
            "   On the screen, a man turned a corner. The Mechanical Hound rushed forward into the viewer, suddenly. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the man.\n",
            "   A voice cried, “Theres Montag! The search is done!”\n",
            "   The innocent man stood bewildered, a cigarette burning in his hand. He stared at the Hound, not knowing what it was. He probably never knew. He glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens. The cameras rushed down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victims face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target.\n",
            "   “Montag, dont move!” said a voice from the sky.\n",
            "   The camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him simultaneously. The victim was seized by Hound and camera in a great spidering, clenching grip. He screamed. He screamed. He screamed!\n",
            "   Blackout.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   Montag cried out in the silence and turned away.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   And then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces expressionless, an announcer on the dark screen said, “The search is over, Montag is dead; a crime against society has been avenged.”\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   “We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a half-hour of Just-Before-Dawn, a programme of-”\n",
            "   Granger turned it off.\n",
            "   “They didnt show the mans face in focus. Did you notice?\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Even your best friends couldnt tell if it was you. They scrambled it just enough to let the imagination take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen, trembling.\n",
            "   Granger touched Montags arm. “Welcome back from the dead.” Montag nodded. Granger went on. “You might as well know all of us, now. This is Fred Clement, former occupant of the Thomas Hardy chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Engineering School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U. C. L. A., a specialist in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for ethics, an ancient study now, for Columbia University quite some years ago. Reverend Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one Sunday and the next for his views. Hes been bumming with us some time now. Myself: I wrote a book called The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and Society, and here I am! Welcome, Montag!”\n",
            "   “I dont belong with you,” said Montag, at last, slowly. “Ive been an idiot all the way.”\n",
            "   “Were used to that. We all made the right kind of mistakes, or we wouldnt be here. When we were separate individuals, all we had was rage. I struck a fireman when he came to burn my library years ago. Ive been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “What have you to offer?”\n",
            "   “Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Revelation, but I havent even that now.”\n",
            "   “The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. Where was it?”\n",
            "   “Here,” Montag touched his head.\n",
            "   “Ah,” Granger smiled and nodded.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong? Isnt that all right?” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Better than all right; perfect!” Granger turned to the Reverend. “Do we have a Book of Ecclesiastes?”\n",
            "   “One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” Granger took Montags shoulder firmly. “Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important youve become in the last minute!”\n",
            "   “But Ive forgotten!”\n",
            "   “No, nothings ever lost. We have ways to shake down your clinkers for you.”\n",
            "   “But Ive tried to remember!”\n",
            "   “Dont try. Itll come when we need it. All of us have photographic memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now weve got the method down to where we can recall anything thats been read once. Would you like, some day, Montag, to read Platos Republic?”\n",
            "   “Of course!”\n",
            "   “I am Platos Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons is Marcus.”\n",
            "   “How do you do?” said Mr. Simmons.\n",
            "   “Hello,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political book, Gullivers Travels! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and-this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and this one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.”\n",
            "   Everyone laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “It cant be,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “It is,” replied Granger, smiling.” Were book-burners, too. We read the books and burnt them, afraid theyd be found. Micro-filming didnt pay off; we were always travelling, we didnt want to bury the film and come back later. Always the chance of discovery. Better to keep it in the old heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and pieces of history and literature and international law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, its here. And the hour is late. And the wars begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a thousand colours. What do you think, Montag?”\n",
            "   “I think I was blind trying to do things my way, planting books in firemens houses and sending in alarms.”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully. But our way is simpler and, we think, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need, intact and safe. Were not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are destroyed, the knowledge is dead, perhaps for good. We are model citizens, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the city people let us be. Were stopped and searched occasionally, but theres nothing on our persons to incriminate us. The organization is flexible, very loose, and fragmentary. Some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and fingerprints. Right now we have a horrible job; were waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end. Its not pleasant, but then were not in control, were the odd minority crying in the wilderness. When the wars over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world.”\n",
            "   “Do you really think theyll listen then?”\n",
            "   “If not, well just have to wait. Well pass the books on to our children, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course.\n",
            "   But you cant make people listen. They have to come round in their own time, wondering what happened and why the world blew up under them. It cant last.”\n",
            "   “How many of you are there?”\n",
            "   “Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, bums on the outside, libraries inside. It wasnt planned, at first. Each man had a book he wanted to remember, and did. Then, over a period of twenty years or so, we met each other, travelling, and got the loose network together and set out a plan. The most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not important, we mustnt be pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world. Were nothing more than dust-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise. Some of us live in small towns. Chapter One of Thoreaus Walden in Green River, Chapter Two in Willow Farm, Maine. Why, theres one town in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bombll ever touch that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And when the wars over, some day, some year, the books can be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what they know and well set it up in type until another Dark Age, when we might have to do the whole damn thing over again. But thats the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing.”\n",
            "   “What do we do tonight?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Wait,” said Granger. “And move downstream a little way, just in case.”\n",
            "   He began throwing dust and dirt on the fire.\n",
            "   The other men helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the wilderness, the men all moved their hands, putting out the fire together.\n",
            "   They stood by the river in the starlight.\n",
            "   Montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. Five. Five oclock in the morning. Another year ticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river.\n",
            "   “Why do you trust me?” said Montag.\n",
            "   A man moved in the darkness.\n",
            "   “The look of yous enough. You havent seen yourself in a mirror lately. Beyond that, the city has never cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses in their heads cant touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone knows it. So long as the vast population doesnt wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the Constitution, its all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities dont bother us. And you look like hell.”\n",
            "   They moved along the bank of the river, going south. Montag tried to see the mens faces, the old faces he remembered from the firelight, lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perhaps he had expected their faces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried, to glow as lanterns glow, with the light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these men had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race, searched a long search, seen good things destroyed, and now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the lamps. They werent at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every future dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the customers who might come by in later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers.\n",
            "   Montag squinted from one face to another as they walked.\n",
            "   “Dont judge a book by its cover,” someone said.\n",
            "   And they all laughed quietly, moving downstream.\n",
            "   There was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up. Montag stared back at the city, far down the river, only a faint glow now.\n",
            "   “My wifes back there.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry to hear that. The cities wont do well in the next few days,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “Its strange, I dont miss her, its strange I dont feel much of anything,” said Montag. “Even if she dies, I realized a moment ago, I dont think Ill feel sad. It isnt right. Something must be wrong with me.”\n",
            "   “Listen,” said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind man who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slum in our town; and he made toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his hands. And when he died, I suddenly realized I wasnt crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. Ive never gotten over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands. He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten million fine actions the night he passed on.”\n",
            "   Montag walked in silence. “Millie, Millie,” he whispered. “Millie.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I cant remember anything. I think of her hands but I dont see them doing anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or theres a cigarette in them, but thats all.”\n",
            "   Montag turned and glanced back.\n",
            "   What did you give to the city, Montag?\n",
            "   Ashes.\n",
            "   What did the others give to each other?\n",
            "   Nothingness.\n",
            "   Granger stood looking back with Montag. “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, youre there. It doesnt matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”\n",
            "   Granger moved his hand. “My grandfather showed me some V-2 rocket films once, fifty years ago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb mushroom from two hundred miles up? Its a pinprick, its nothing. With the wilderness all around it.\n",
            "   “My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people that were allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back what it has given, as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so big. When we forget how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be. You see?” Granger turned to Montag. “Grandfathers been dead for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by God, in the convolutions of my brain youd find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me. As I said earlier, he was a sculptor. ‘I hate a Roman named Status Quo!’ he said to me. ‘Stuff your eyes with wonder,’ he said, ‘live as if youd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. Its more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,’ he said, ‘shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.’”\n",
            "   “Look!” cried Montag.\n",
            "   And the war began and ended in that instant.\n",
            "   Later, the men around Montag could not say if they had really seen anything. Perhaps the merest flourish of light and motion in the sky. Perhaps the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles, one mile up, for the merest instant, like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand, and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning city they had left behind. The bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished, once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour; as quick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a full three seconds, all of the time in history, before the bombs struck, the enemy ships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander might not believe because they were invisible; yet the heart is suddenly shattered, the body falls in separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air; the brain squanders its few precious memories and, puzzled, dies.\n",
            "   This was not to be believed. It was merely a gesture. Montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist over the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, disintegrate, leave no stone on another, perish. Die.\n",
            "   Montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. “Run!” he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, “Run!” To Mildred, “Get out, get out of there!” But Clarisse, he remembered, was dead. And Faber was out; there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five a. m. bus was on its way from one desolation to another. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man could make it. Before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway, its destination would be meaningless, and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard.\n",
            "   And Mildred...\n",
            "   Get out, run!\n",
            "   He saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her building. He saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of colour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her, where the family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a half-inch, now a quarter-inch from the top of the hotel. Leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, nervously, as if to plunge, drop, fall into that swarming immensity of colour to drown in its bright happiness.\n",
            "   The first bomb struck.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Perhaps, who would ever know? Perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of colour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion.\n",
            "   Montag, falling flat, going down, saw or felt, or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in Millies face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own face reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of itself, that at last she recognized it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way.\n",
            "   I remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago. Chicago, a long time ago. Millie and I. Thats where we met! I remember now. Chicago. A long time ago.\n",
            "   The concussion knocked the air across and down the river, turned the men over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in lifting sprays, and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn with a great wind passing away south. Montag crushed himself down, squeezing himself small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant saw the city, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For another of those impossible instants the city stood, rebuilt and unrecognizable, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had built it, erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a reversed avalanche, a million colours, a million oddities, a door where a window should be, a top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell down dead.\n",
            "   Montag, lying there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth, gasping and crying, now thought again, I remember, I remember, I remember something else. What is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it, quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off, before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to himself silently, lying flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denhams Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Preacher by himself, standing there in his mind, looking at him...\n",
            "   “There,” said a voice.\n",
            "   The men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass. They held to the earth as children hold to familiar things, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from bursting, to keep their sanity from bursting, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed.\n",
            "   Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And lying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now. Silence fell down in the sifting dust, and all the leisure they might need to look around, to gather the reality of this day into their senses.\n",
            "   Montag looked at the river. Well go on the river. He looked at the old railroad tracks. Or well go that way. Or well walk on the highways now, and well have time to put things into ourselves. And some day, after it sets in us a long time, itll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a lot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. Well just start walking today and see the world and the way the world walks around and talks, the way it really looks. I want to see everything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a while itll all gather together inside and itll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where its finally me, where its in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I get hold of it so itll never run off. Ill hold on to the world tight some day. Ive got one finger on it now; thats a beginning.\n",
            "   The wind died.\n",
            "   The other men lay a while, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and begin the days obligations, its fires and foods, its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They lay blinking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then slow...\n",
            "   Montag sat up.\n",
            "   He did not move any further, however. The other men did likewise. The sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain.\n",
            "   Silently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the river to look upstream.\n",
            "   “Its flat,” he said, a long time later. “City looks like a heap of baking-powder. Its gone.” And a long time after that. “I wonder how many knew it was coming? I wonder how many were surprised?”\n",
            "   And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a thousand?\n",
            "   Someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet and sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly, with nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down.\n",
            "   Granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. “Well have a bite. Then well turn around and walk upstream. Theyll be needing us up that way.”\n",
            "   Someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it and the frying-pan was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this ritual silently.\n",
            "   Granger looked into the fire. “Phoenix.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ: every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like were doing the same thing, over and over, but weve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things weve done for a thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day well stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember, every generation.”\n",
            "   He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully.\n",
            "   “Now, lets get on upstream,” said Granger. “And hold on to one thought: Youre not important. Youre not anything. Some day the load were carrying with us may help someone. But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didnt use what we got out of them. We went right on insulting the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. Were going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month and the next year. And when they ask us what were doing, you can say, Were remembering. Thats where well win out in the long run. And some day well remember so much that well build the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up. Come on now, were going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them.”\n",
            "   They finished eating and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been given more wick. In the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down.\n",
            "   Montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him, going north. He was surprised, and moved aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of hay, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going until he caught up with the people.\n",
            "   But now there was a long mornings walk until noon, and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things they remembered, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them. Montag felt the slow stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else? Something, something...\n",
            "   And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n",
            "   Yes, thought Montag, thats the one Ill save for noon. For noon...\n",

            "   After all, my alienist, truly alien, had the coincidental name, Von Seyfertitz, of the tall, lean, aquiline, menacing, and therefore beautiful actor who played the high priest in the 1935 film She.\n",
            "   In She, the wondrous villain waved his skeleton fingers, hurled insults, summoned sulfured flames, destroyed slaves, and knocked the world into earthquakes.\n",

            "   As you can see, Gustav Von Seyfertitz was a most unusual mine specialist. Mine? Yes. Our problems are land mines in our heads. Step on them! Shock-troop therapy, he once called it, searching for words. “Blitzkrieg?” I offered.\n",
            "   “Ja!” He grinned his shark grin. “Thats it!”\n",
            "   Again, this was my third visit to his strange, metallic-looking room with a most odd series of locks on a roundish door. Suddenly, as I was maundering and treading dark waters, I heard his spine stiffen behind me.

            "   Gustav Von Seyfertitz stood pretending not to notice me, the sweat-oiled leather couch, or the vanished brass machine. Very calmly, in the fashion of Conrad Veidt in Casablanca, or Erich Von\n",

            "   I almost heard the torpedo leave its tube. “Fire two!” he said.\n",

            "   “Id rather not,” I said uneasily.\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye, raked at an angle, glared at me. It had an uncanny resemblance, in its glassy coldness, his own fierce hawks gaze.\n",
            "   His voice, from behind the periscope, echoed. “So you want to know, eh, how Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, suffered to leave the cold ocean depths, depart his dear North Sea ship, flee his destroyed and beaten fatherland, to become the Unterderseaboat Doktor—”\n",
            "   “Now that you mention—”\n",

            "   His heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me: a bright, thin monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg. I winced. For now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with cold fire.\n",
            "   “Why the monocle?” I said.\n",
            "   “Idiot! It is to cover my good eye so that neither there eye can see and my intuition is free to work!”\n",

            "   And he began his monologue. And as he talked I realized his need had been pent up, capped, years, so he talked on and on, forgetting me.\n",
            "   And it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred. I rose slowly to my feet as Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz circled, his long, slim cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air, which read like white Rorschach blots.\n",
            "   With each implantation of his foot, a word ca out, and then another, in a sort of plodding grammar. Sometimes he stopped and stood poised with one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his tongue and examined. Then the shoe went down, the noun slid forth and the verb and object in good time.\n",
            "   Until at last, circling, I found myself in a chair stunned, for I saw:\n",
            "   Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz stretched on his couch, his long spider fingers laced on his chest.\n",
            "   “It has been no easy thing to come forth on land,” he sibilated. “Some days I was the jellyfish, frozen. Others, the shore-strewn octopi, at least with tentacles, or the crayfish sucked back into my skull. But I have built my spine, year on year, and now I walk among the land men and survive.”\n",
            "   He paused to take a trembling breath, then continued:\n",
            "   “I moved in stages from the depths to a houseboat, to a wharf bungalow, to a shore-tent and then back to a canal in a city and at last to New York an island surrounded by water, eh?

            "   “Dive!” I screamed so loudly that my fellow passengers, in shock, peed merrily. Among stunned faces, I stepped out of the lift to find one-sixteenth of an inch of pee on the floor. “Have a nice day!” I said, jubilant with self-discovery, then ran to self-employment, to hang a shingle and next my periscope, carried from the mutilated, divested, castrated unterderseaboat all these years. Too stupid to see in it my psychological future and my final downfall, my beautiful artifact, the brass genitalia of psychotic research, the Von Seyfertitz Mark Nine Periscope!”\n",

            "   “So? I have often wondered: did Nemo really die when his submarine was destroyed? Or did he run off to become my great-grandfather and were his psychological bacteria passed along until I came into the world, thinking to command the ghostlike mechanisms that haunt the under tides, to wind up with the fifty-minute vaudeville routine in this sad, psychotic city?”\n",

            "   And in the instant another thought came: how much of that stuff in there is me? Or Von Seyfertitz? Or both? Are these strange shapes my maundering daymares, sneezed out in the past weeks? When I talked, eyes shut, did my mouth spray invisible founts of small beasts which, caught in the periscope chambers, grew outsize? Like the microscopic photos of those germs that hide in eyebrows and pores, magnified a million times to become elephants on Scientific American covers? Are these images from other lost souls trapped on that couch and caught in the submarine device, or leftovers from my eyelashes and psyche?\n",

            "   “Nuts,” I said. “Youre bored. I could get you a five-million-dollar deal with Amalgamated Fruit-cakes Inc. And the Sigmund F. Dreamboats, split three ways!”\n",
            "   “You dont understand,” said Von Seyfertitz. “I am keeping myself busy, busy, so I wont remember all the people I torpedoed, sank, drowned mid-Atlantic in 1944. I am not in the Amalgamated Fruitcake Cinema business. I only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails, cleaning earwax, and erasing inkblots from odd bean-bags like you. If I stop, I will fly apart. That periscope contains all and everything I have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans, cashews, and almonds. By staring at them I lose my own terrible life lost in the tides. If you won my periscope in some shoddy fly-by-night Hollywood strip poker, I would sink three times in my waterbed, never to be seen again. Have I shown you my waterbed? Three times as large as any pool. I do eighty laps asleep each night. Some-times forty when I catnap noons. To answer your million fold offer, no.”\n",

            "   “My God!” he shouted.\n",
            "   Too late, he was realizing he had let me step into his mind and life. Now he was on his feet between me and the periscope, staring at it and me, as if we were both terrors.\n",

Such a goddamn ridiculous... hey, wait a minute. You!”\n",
            "   It was as if he had slipped a devil mask over his face. His eyes grew wide. His mouth gaped.\n",
            "   I examined his face and saw murder. I sidled toward the door.\n",
            "   “You wouldnt say anything to anyone?” he said.\n",

            "   “How come you suddenly know everything about me?”\n",
            "   “You told me!”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he admitted, dazed, looking around for a weapon. “Wait.”\n",
            "   “if you dont mind,” I said, “Id rather not.” And I was out the door and down the hall, my knees jumping to knock my jaw.\n",
            "   “Come back!” cried Von Seyfertitz, behind me. “I must kill you!”\n",
            "   “I was afraid of that!”\n",
            "   I reached the elevator first and by a miracle it flung wide its doors when I banged the Down button. I jumped in.\n",
            "   “Say good-bye!” cried Von Seyfertitz, raising his fist as if it held a bomb.\n",
            "   “Good-bye!” I said. The doors slammed.\n",
            "   I did not see Von Seyfertitz again for a year.\n",

            "   So with my giving one shake of the ripe fruit tree, nuts fell. Overnight they brimmed the Barons lap to flood his bank account. His Grand Slam will be recalled at centurys end: appearances on Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey, and Gerarldo in one single cyclonic afternoon, with interchangeable hyperboles, positive-negative-positive every hour. There were Von Seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine periscope sold at the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. With the super inducement of a half-million dollars, he force-fed and easily sold a bad book. Duplicates of the animalcules, lurks, and curious critters trapped in his brass viewer arose in pop-up coloring books, paste-on tattoos, and inkpad rubberstamp nightmares at Beasts-R-Us.\n",
            "   I had hoped that all this would cause him to forgive and forget. No.\n",
            "   One noon a year and a month later, my doorbell rang and there stood Gustav Von Seyfertitz, F Baron Woldstein, tears streaming down his cheeks.\n",
            "   “How come I didnt kill you that day?” he mourned.\n",
            "   “You didnt catch me,” I said.\n",
            "   “Oh, ja. That was it.”\n",
            "   I looked into the old mans rain-washed, tear-ravened face and said, “Who died?”\n",
            "   “Me. Or is it I? Ah, to hell with it: me. You see before you,” he grieved, “a creature who suffers from the Rumpelstiltskin Syndrome!”\n",
            "   “Rumpel—”\n",
            "   “-stiltskin! Two halves with a rip from chin to fly. Yank my forelock, go ahead! Watch me fall apart at the seam. Like zipping a psychotic zipper, I fall, two Herr Doktor Admirals for the sick price of one. And which is the Doktor who heals and which the sellout best-seller Admiral? It takes two mirrors to tell. Not to mention the smoke!”\n",
            "   He stopped and looked around, holding his head together with his hands.\n",
            "   “Can you see the crack? Am I splitting again to become this crazy sailor who desires richness and fame, being sieved through the hands of crazed ladies with ruptured libidos? Suffering fish, I call them! But take their money, spit, spend! You should have such a year. Dont laugh.”\n",
            "   “Im not laughing.”\n",
            "   “Then cheer up while I finish. Can I lie down? Is that a couch? Too short. What do I do with my legs?”\n",
            "   “Sit sidesaddle.”\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz laid himself out with his legs draped over one side. “Hey, not bad. Sit behind. Dont look over my shoulder. Avert your gaze. Neither smirk nor pull long faces as I get out the crazy-glue and paste Rumpel back with Stiltskin, the name of my next book, God help me. Damn you to hell, you and your damned periscope!”\n",
            "   “Not mine. Yours. You wanted me to discover it that day. I suppose you had been whispering Dive, Dive, for years to patients, half asleep. But you couldnt resist the loudest scream ever: Dive! That was your captain speaking, wanting fame and money enough to chock a horse show.”\n",
            "   “God,” murmured Von Seyfertitz, “How I hate it when youre honest. Feeling better already. How much do I owe you?”\n",
            "   He arose.\n",
            "   “Now we go kill the monsters instead of you.”\n",
            "   “Monsters?”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   We got out of the elevator to be confronted by a long line of worshippers and supplicants. There\n",
            "   must have been seventy people strung out between the elevator and the Barons door, waiting with copies of books by Madame Blavatsky, Krishna murti, and Shirley MacLaine under their arms. There was a roar like a suddenly opened furnace door when they saw the Baron. We beat it on the double and got inside his office before anyone could surge to follow.\n",
            "   “See what you have done to me!” Von Seyfertitz pointed.\n",
            "   The office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling. The desk was from Napoleons age an exquisite Empire piece worth at least fifty thousand dollars. The couch was the best soft leather I had ever seen, and the two pictures on the wall were originals-a Renoir and a Monet. My God, millions! I thought.\n",
            "   “Okay,” I said. “The beasts, you said. Youll kill them, not me?”\n",
            "   The old man wiped his eyes with the back of one hand, then made a fist.\n",
            "   “Yes!” he cried, stepping up to the fine periscope, which reflected his face, madly distorted, in its elongated shape. “Like this. Thus and so!”\n",
            "   And before I could prevent, he gave the brass machine a terrific slap with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another, with both fists, cursing. Then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of a spoiled child and throttled and shook it.\n",
            "   I cannot say what I heard in that instant. Perhaps real sounds, perhaps imagined temblors, like a glacier\n",
            "   cracking in the spring, or icicles in mid-night. Perhaps it was a sound like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in folds of tissue. Maybe I thought I heard a vast breath in sucked, a cloud dissolving up inside itself. Or did I sense clock machineries spun so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass snowflakes?\n",
            "   I put my eye to the periscope.\n",
            "   I looked in upon—\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",
            "   It was just a brass tube with some crystal lenses and a view of an empty couch.\n",
            "   No more.\n",
            "   I seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an unimaginable horizon.\n",
            "   But the couch remained only a couch, and the wall beyond looked back at me with its great blank face.\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to fall on one rusted fist.\n",
            "   “Are they dead?” he whispered.\n",
            "   “Gone.”\n",
            "   “Good, they deserved to die. Now I can return to some kind of normal, sane world.”\n",
            "   And with each word his voice fell deeper within his throat, his chest, his soul, until it, like the vaporous haunts within the peri-kaleidoscope, melted into silence.\n",
            "   He clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp\n",
            "   of prayer, like one who beseeches God to deliver him from plagues. And whether he was once again praying for my death, eyes shut, or whether he simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device, I could not say.\n",
            "   I only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing. Me and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this incredible captain from beneath Nemos tidal seas.\n",
            "   “Gone,” murmured Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, whispered for the last time. “Gone.”\n",
            "   That was almost the end.\n",
            "   I went around a month later. The landlord reluctantly let me look over the premises, mostly because I hinted that I might be renting.\n",
            "   We stood in the middle of the empty room where I could see the dent marks where the couch had once stood.\n",
            "   I looked up at the ceiling. It was empty.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said the landlord. “Didnt they fix it so you cant see? Damn fool Baron made a damn big hole up into the office above. Rented that, too, but never used it for anything I knew of. There was just that big damn hole he left when he went away.”\n",
            "   I sighed with relief.\n",
            "   “Nothing left upstairs?”\n",

            "   What, I often wonder, ever happened to Gustav Von Seyfertitz? Did he move to Vienna, to take up residence, perhaps, in or near dear Sigmunds very own address? Does he live in Rio, aerating fellow Unterderseaboat Captains who cant sleep for seasickness, roiling on their waterbeds under the shadow of the Andes Cross? Or is he in South Pasadena, within striking distance of the fruit larder nut farms disguised as film studios?\n",
            "   I cannot guess.\n",

            "   Bella Winters sat up in bed about three a. m. and listened and then lay back down. Ten minutes later she heard the sounds again, out in the night, down the hill.\n",
            "   Bella Winters lived in a first-floor apartment on top of Vendome Heights, near Effie Street in Los Angeles, and had lived there now for only a few days, so it was all new to her, this old house on an old street with an old staircase, made of concrete, climbing steeply straight up from the low-lands below, one hundred and twenty steps, count them. And right now... \n",
            "   “Someones on the steps,” said Bella to herself.\n",
            "   “What?” said her husband, Sam, in his sleep.\n",
            "   “There are some men out on the steps,” said Bella. “Talking, yelling, not fighting, but almost. I heard them last night, too, and the night before, but...\n",
            "   “What?” Sam muttered.\n",
            "   “Shh, go to sleep. Ill look.”\n",
            "   She got out of bed in the dark and went to the window, and yes, two men were indeed talking out there, grunting, groaning, now loud, now soft. And there was another noise, a kind of bumping, sliding, thumping, like a huge object being carted up the hill.\n",
            "   “No one could be moving in at this hour of the night, could they?” asked Bella of the darkness, the window, and herself.\n",
            "   “No,” murmured Sam.\n",
            "   “It sounds like...\n",
            "   “Like what?” asked Sam, fully awake now.\n",
            "   “Like two men moving—”\n",

            "   “A piano and two men. Just listen.”\n",
            "   The husband sat up, blinking, alert.\n",
            "   Far off, in the middle of the hill, there was a kind harping strum, the noise a piano makes when suddenly thumped and its harp strings hum.\n",
            "   “There, did you hear?”\n",
            "   “Jesus, youre right. But why would anyone steal—”\n",

            "   “I didnt make the rules, Sam. Go out and ask. No, dont; I will.”\n",
            "   And she wrapped herself in her robe and was out the door and on the sidewalk.\n",
            "   “Bella,” Sam whispered fiercely behind the porch screen. “Crazy.”\n",
            "   “So what can happen at night to a woman fifty-five, fat, and ugly?” she wondered.\n",
            "   Sam did not answer.\n",
            "   She moved quietly to the rim of the hill. Somewhere down there she could hear the two men wrestling with a huge object. The piano on occasion gave a strumming hum and fell silent. occasionally one of the men yelled or gave orders.\n",
            "   “The voices,” said Bella. “I know them from somewhere,” she whispered and moved in utter dark on stairs that were only a long pale ribbon going down, as a voice echoed:\n",
            "   “Heres another fine mess youve got us in.” Bella froze. Where have I heard that voice, she wondered, a million times!\n",
            "   “Hello,” she called.\n",
            "   She moved, counting the steps, and stopped.\n",
            "   And there was no one there.\n",
            "   Suddenly she was very cold. There was nowhere for the strangers to have gone to. The hill was steep and a long way down and a long way up, and they had been burdened with an upright piano, hadnt they?\n",
            "   How come I know upright? she thought. I only heard. But-yes, upright! Not only that, but inside a box!\n",
            "   She turned slowly and as she went back up the steps, one by one, slowly, slowly, the voices began to sound again, below, as if, disturbed, they had waited for her to go away.\n",
            "   “What are you doing?” demanded one voice.\n",
            "   “I was just—” said the other.\n",
            "   “Give me that!” cried the first voice.\n",
            "   That other voice, thought Bella, I know that, too. And I know whats going to be said next!\n",
            "   “Now,” said the echo far down the hill in the night, “just dont stand there, help me!”\n",
            "   “Yes!” Bella closed her eyes and swallowed hard and half fell to sit on the steps, getting her breath back as black-and-White pictures flashed in her head. Suddenly it was 1929 and she Was very small, in a theater with dark and light pictures looming above the first row where she sat, transfixed, and then laughing, and then transfixed and laughing again.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   She opened her eyes. The two voices were still down there, a faint wrestle and echo in the night, despairing and thumping each other with their hard derby hats.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Zelda, thought Bella Winters. Ill call Zelda. She knows everything. Shell tell me what this is. Zelda, yes!\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Inside, she dialed Z and E and L and D and A before she saw what she had done and started over. The phone rang a long while until Zeldas voice, angry with sleep, spoke half way across L. A.\n",

            "   “Zelda, I know youre going to think Im crazy, but...”\n",
            "   “Go ahead, be crazy.”\n",
            "   “Zelda, in the old days when they made films around L. A., they used lots of places, right? Like Venice, Ocean Park...”\n",
            "   “Chaplin did, Langdon did, Harold Lloyd, sure.”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy, did they use lots of locations?”\n",
            "   “Palms, they used Palms lots, Culver City Main Street,” Effie Street.”\n",
            "   “Effie Street!”\n",
            "   “Dont yell, Bella.”\n",
            "   “Did you say Effie Street?”\n",
            "   “Sure, and God, its three in the morning!”\n",
            "   “Right at the top of Effie Street!?”\n",
            "   “Hey, yeah, the stairs. Everyone knows them. Thats where the music box chased Hardy downhill and ran over Him.”\n",
            "   “Sure, Zelda, sure! Oh, God, Zelda, if you could see, hear, what I hear!”\n",
            "   Zelda was suddenly wide awake on the line. “Whats going on? You serious?”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, yes. On the steps just now, and last night and the night before maybe, I heard, I hear—two men hauling a—a piano up the hill.”\n",
            "   “Someones pulling your leg!”\n",
            "   “No, no, theyre there. I go out and theres nothing. But the steps are haunted, Zelda! One voice says: “Heres another fine mess youve got us in. “You got to hear that mans voice!”\n",
            "   “Youre drunk and doing this because you know Im a nut for them.”\n",
            "   “No, no. Come, Zelda. Listen. Tell!”\n",
            "   Maybe half an hour later, Bella heard the old tin lizzie rattle up the alley behind the apartments. It was a car Zelda, in her joy at visiting silent-movie theaters, had bought to lug herself around in while she wrote about the past, always the past, and steaming into Cecil B. DeMilles old place or circling Harold Lloyds nation-state, or cranking and banging around the Universal backlot, paying her respects to the Phantoms opera stage, or sitting on Ma and Pa Kettles porch chewing a sandwich lunch. That was Zelda, who once wrote in a silent country in a silent time for Silver Screen.\n",
            "   Zelda lumbered across the front porch, a huge body with legs as big as the Bernini columns in front of St. Peters in Rome, and a face like a harvest moon.\n",
            "   On that round face now was suspicion, cynicism, skepticisms, in equal pie-parts. But when she saw Bellas pale stare she cried:\n",
            "   “Belle!”\n",
            "   “You see Im not lying!” said Bella.\n",
            "   “I see!”\n",
            "   “Keep your voice down, Zelda. Oh, its scary and strange, terrible and nice. So come on.”\n",
            "   And the two women edged along the walk to the rim of the old hill near the old steps in old Hollywood, and suddenly as they moved they felt time take a half turn around them and it was another year, because nothing had changed all the buildings were the way they were in 1928 and the hills beyond like they were in 1926 and the steps, just the, way they were when the cement was poured in 1921.\n",
            "   “Listen, Zelda. There!”\n",
            "   And Zelda listened and at first there was only a creaking of wheels down in the dark, like crickets, and then a moan of wood and a hum of piano strings, and then one voice lamenting about this job, and the other voice claiming he had nothing to do with it, and then the thumps as two derby hats fell, and an exasperated voice announced:\n",
            "   “Heres another fine mess youve got us in.”\n",
            "   Zelda, stunned, almost toppled off the hill. She held tight to Bellas arm as tears brimmed in her eyes.\n",
            "   “Its a trick. Someones got a tape recorder or—”\n",
            "   “No, I checked. Nothing but the steps, Zelda, the steps!”\n",
            "   Tears rolled down Zeldas plump cheeks.\n",
            "   “Oh, God, that is his voice! Im the expert, Im the mad, fanatic, Bella. Thats Ollie. And that other voice, Stan! And youre not nuts after all!”\n",
            "   The voices below rose and fell and one cried: “Why dont you do something to help me?”\n",
            "   Zelda moaned. “Oh, God, its so beautiful.”\n",
            "   “What does it mean?” asked Bella. “Why are they here? Are they really ghosts, and why would ghosts climb this hill every night, pushing that music box, night after night, tell me, Zelda, why?”\n",
            "   Zelda peered down the hill and shut her eyes for a moment to think. “Why do any ghosts go anywhere? Retribution? Revenge? No, not those two. Love maybes the reason, lost loves or something Yes?”\n",
            "   Bella let her heart pound once or twice and then said, “Maybe nobody told them.”\n",
            "   “Told them what?”\n",
            "   “Or maybe they were told a lot but still didnt believe, because maybe in their old years things got bad, I mean they were sick, and sometimes when youre sick you forget.”\n",
            "   “Forget what!?”\n",
            "   “How much we loved them.”\n",
            "   “They knew!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Did they? Sure, we told each other, but maybe not enough of us ever wrote or waved when they passed and just yelled “Love!” you think?”\n",
            "   “Hell, Bella, theyre on TV every night!”\n",
            "   “Yeah, but that dont count. Has anyone, since they left us, come here to these steps and said? Maybe those voices down there, ghosts or whatever, have been here every night for years, pushing that music box, and nobody thought, or tried, to just whisper or yell all the love we had all the years. Why not?”\n",
            "   “Why not?” Zelda stared down into the long darkness where perhaps shadows moved and maybe a piano lurched clumsily among the shadows. “Youre right.”\n",
            "   If Im right,” said Bella, “and you say so, theres only one thing to do—”\n",
            "   “You mean you and me?”\n",
            "   “Who else? Quiet. Come on.”\n",
            "   They moved down a step. In the same instant lights came on around them, in a window here, another there. A screen door opened somewhere and angry words shot out into the night:\n",
            "   “Hey, whats going on?”\n",
            "   “Pipe down!”\n",
            "   “You know what time it is?” “My God,” Bella whispered, “everyone else hears now!”\n",
            "   “No, no.” Zelda looked around wildly. “Theyll spoil everything!”\n",
            "   “Im calling the cops!” A window slammed.\n",
            "   “God,” said Bella, “if the cops come—”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Itll be all wrong. If anyones going to tell them to take it easy, pipe down, its gotta be us. We care, dont we?”\n",
            "   “God, yes, but—”\n",
            "   “No buts. Grab on. Here we go.”\n",
            "   The two voices murmured below and the piano tuned itself with hiccups of sound as they edged down another step and another, their mouths dry, hearts hammering, and the night so dark they could see only the faint streetlight at the stair bottom, the single street illumination so far away it was sad being there all by itself, waiting for shadows to move.\n",
            "   More windows slammed up, more screen doors opened. At any moment there would be an avalanche of protest, incredible outcries, perhaps shots fired, and all this gone forever.\n",
            "   Thinking this, the women trembled and held tight, as if to pummel each other to speak against the rage.\n",
            "   “Say something, Zelda, quick.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Anything! Theyll get hurt if we dont—”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know what I mean. Save them.”\n",
            "   “Okay. Jesus!” Zelda froze, clamped her eyes shut to find the words, then opened her eyes and said, “Hello.”\n",
            "   “Louder.”\n",
            "   “Hello,” Zelda called softly, then loudly.\n",
            "   Shapes rustled in the dark below. One of the voices rose while the other fell and the piano strummed its hidden harp strings.\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called\n",
            "   “Thats good. Go on.”\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called, braver now. “Dont listen to those others yelling. We wont hurt you. Its just us. Im Zelda, you wouldnt remember, and this here is Bella, and weve known you forever, or since we were kids, and we love you. Its late, but we thought you should know. Weve loved you ever since you were in the desert or on that boat with ghosts or trying to sell Christmas trees door-to-door or in that traffic where you tore the headlights off cars, and we still love you, right, Bella?”\n",
            "   The night below was darkness, waiting.\n",
            "   Zelda punched Bellas arm.\n",
            "   “Yes!” Bella cried, “what she said. We love you.”\n",
            "   “We cant think of anything else to say.”\n",
            "   “But its enough, yes?” Bella leaned forward anxiously. “Its enough?”\n",
            "   A night wind stirred the leaves and grass around the stairs and the shadows below that had stopped moving with the music box suspended between them as they looked up and up at the two women, who suddenly began to cry. First tears fell from Bellas cheeks, and when Zelda sensed them, she let fall her own.\n",
            "   “So now,” said Zelda, amazed that she could form words but managed to speak anyway, “we want you to know, you don t have to come back anymore. You dont have to climb\n",
            "   the hill every night, waiting. For what we said just now is it, isnt it? I mean you wanted to hear it here on this hill, with those steps, and that piano, yes, thats the whole thing, it had to be that, didnt it? So now here we are and there you are and its said. So rest, dear friends.”\n",
            "   “Oh, there, Ollie,” added Bella in a sad, sad whisper. “Oh, Stan, Stanley.”\n",
            "   The piano, hidden in the dark, softly hummed its wires and creaked its ancient wood.\n",
            "   And then the most incredible thing happened. There was: a series of shouts and then a huge banging crash as the music box, in the dark, rocketed down the hill, skittering on the steps, playing chords where it hit, swerving, rushing, and ahead of it, running, the two shapes pursued by the musical beast, yelling, tripping, shouting, warning the Fates, crying out to the gods, down and down, forty, sixty, eighty, one hundred steps.\n",
            "   And half down the steps, hearing, feeling, shouting, crying themselves, and now laughing and holding to each other, the two women alone in the night wildly clutching, grasping, trying to see, almost sure that they did see, the three things ricocheting off and away, the two shadows rushing, one fat,, one thin, and the piano blundering after, discordant and mindless, until they reached the street, where, instantly, the one overhead streetlamp died as if struck, and the shadows floundered on, pursued by the musical beast.\n",
            "   And the two women, abandoned, looked down, exhausted with laughing until they wept and weeping until they laughed, until suddenly Zelda got a terrible look on her face as if shot.\n",
            "   “My God!” she shouted in panic, reaching out. “Wait. We didnt mean, we dont want-dont go forever! Sure, go. so the neighbors here sleep. But once a year, you hear? Once a year, one night a year from tonight, and every year after that, come back. It shouldnt bother anyone so much. But we got to tell you all over again, huh? Come back and bring the box with you, and well be here waiting, wont we, Bella?”\n",
            "   “Waiting, yes.”\n",
            "   There was a long silence from the steps leading down into an old black-and-white, silent Los Angeles.\n",
            "   “You think they heard?”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   And from somewhere far off and down, there was the faintest explosion like the engine of an old jalopy knocking itself to life, and then the merest whisper of a lunatic music from a dark theater when they were very young. It faded.\n",
            "   After a long while they climbed back up the steps, dabbing at their eyes with wet Kleenex. Then they turned for a final time to stare down into the night.\n",
            "   “You know something?” said Zelda. “I think they heard.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "THE ELECTROCUTION\n",
            "   \n",
            "   She let him tie the black silk over her eyes and he knotted it and jerked it so tight that she gasped and said, “Loosen it, damn you, Johnny, loosen it, or I wont go on!”?\n",
            "   “Sure,” he said easily, and she smelled his sharp breath; while beyond; the crowd rustled against the rope barrier and the carnival tent flapped in the night wind, and off, there was a drift of calliope music and the rattle of a trap drum.\n",
            "   Dimly, through the black silk, she could see the men, the boys, the few women, a good crowd, paying out dimes to see her strapped in this electric chair, the electrodes on her wrists and neck, waiting.\n",
            "   “There.” Johnnys voice whispered through the blindfold. “That better?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but her hands gripped the ends of the wooden chair. She felt her pulse beating in her arms and neck... Outside the pitchman yelled through his small cardboard megaphone and slapped his cane across the banner where Electras portrait shivered in the wind: yellow hair, hard blue eyes, sharp chin, seated in her death-chair like Someone come for tea.\n",
            "   With the black silk blinding her, it was easier to let her mind run back to wherever it wanted to go...\n",
            "   The carnival was either setting up in a new town or letting go; its brown tents inhaling by day, exhaling its stale air by night as the canvases slid rustling down along the dark poles. And then?\n",
            "   Last Monday night this young man with the long arms and the eager pink face bought three tickets to the sideshow and stood watching Electra three times as the electricity burned through her like blue fire while this young man strained at the rope barrier, and memorized her every move as she sat high up there on the platform, all fire and pale flesh.\n",
            "   He came four nights in a row.\n",
            "   “You got an audience, Ellie,” said Johnny on the third night.\n",
            "   “So I see,” she said.\n",
            "   “Dont pay no attention,” said Johnny.\n",
            "   “I wont,” she said. “Why should I? Dont worry.”\n",
            "   After all, shed done the act for years. Johnny slammed on the power, and it filled her from ankle to elbows to ears as he handed her the bright sword and she thrust it out blindly over the audience, smiling under her half mask, to let them tap shoulders and brows as the blue sparks crackled and spat. On the fourth night she shoved the sword far out toward the young man with the sweating pink face, first among the crowd. The young man raised his hand swiftly, eagerly, as if to seize the blade. Blue sparks leaped the gap, but his hand didnt flinch or stop as he grabbed on and took the fire in his fingers and then his fist and then his wrist and his arm into his body.\n",
            "   His eyes, in the light, flared with blue alcohol flame, fed by the sword, whose fire in passing lit her arm and face and body. He stretched his hand still farther out, his waist jammed against the rope, silent and tense. Then Johnny cried, “Everybody touch it! Every one!” And Electra lifted the blade out on the air for others to feel and stroke, while Johnny cursed. Through the blindfold she saw the terrible illumination which would not leave the young mans face.\n",
            "   The fifth night, instead of touching the young mans fingers, she tapped the blazing tip of the sword against the palm of his hand, brushing and burning until he shut his eyes.\n",
            "   That night she walked out on the lake pier after the show and did not look back as she moved, but listened and began to smile. The lake shook against the rotting piles. The carnival lights made wandering, uneasy roads on the black water. The Ferris wheel whirled high and around, with its faint screams, and far away the calliope steamed and sobbed “Beautiful Ohio.” She slowed her walking. She put out her right foot, slowly, then her left, then she stopped and turned her head. And as she turned she saw the shadow, and his arms moved around her. A long time later she leaned back in his arms and stared up into his healthy, excited pink face, and said, “My God, youre more dangerous than my chair!”\n",
            "   “Is your name really Electra?” he said.\n",
            "   The next night as the power leaped through her, she stiffened, shuddered, and clamped her lips in her teeth, moaning. Her legs stirred; her hands groped and scratched the chair arms.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong!” Beyond the blindfold, Johnny cried out, “What?”\n",
            "   And cut the power.\n",
            "   “Im all right,” she gasped. The crowd murmured. “Its nothing Go on! Now!”\n",
            "   And he hit the switch.\n",
            "   The fire crawled through her and again she clenched her teeth and threw her head back against the chair. A face rushed out of the dark, and a body with it, to press against her. The power exploded. The electric chair stopped, then melted.\n",
            "   Johnny, a million miles off in the dark, handed her the sword. Her limp, twitching hand dropped it. He handed it back and instinctively she shoved it far out into the night.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Someone, out there in the roaring darkness, touched the blade. She could imagine his eyes burning there, his lips parted as the power jolted him. He was pressed against the rope, hard, hard against the rope, and could not breathe or cry out or pull back!\n",
            "   The power died. The smell of lightning stayed.\n",
            "   “Thats it!” someone cried.\n",
            "   Johnny left her to squirm out of the leather straps, jumped off the low platform, and walked out toward the midway. Convulsively, she tore off the bonds, trembling. She ran from the tent, not looking back to see if the young man was still there against the rope.\n",
            "   She fell upon the cot of the trailer behind the tent, perspiring and shaking, and was still crying when Johnny stepped in to look down at her.\n",
            "   “Whats the matter?” he said.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing, Johnny.”\n",
            "   “What was that you pulled out there just now?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing.”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing,” he said. “Like hell it is.” His face twisted. “Like hell! You havent done anything like that for years!”\n",
            "   “I was nervous!”\n",
            "   “Years its been,” he said. “When we were first married you did that. You think I forgot how when I switched the power on this same happened like tonight? You been sitting in that chair for three years like someone listening to a radio. And tonight, and tonight!” he cried, choking, standing over her, his fists tightened. “Damn it, tonight.”\n",
            "   “Please, please, Johnny. I was nervous.”\n",
            "   “What were you thinking there in the chair?” he demanded, leaning down wildly. “What did you think about?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, Johnny, nothing. “He grabbed her hair. “Please!”\n",
            "   He threw her head down, turned, walked out, and stopped outside. “I know what you were thinking,” he said. “I know.” And she heard his footsteps fade away.\n",
            "   And the night passed and the day and another night with another crowd.\n",
            "   But nowhere in the crowd did she see his face. Now, in the blackness, with the blindfold tight to her face, she sat in the electric chair and waited while Johnny described the wonders of the Skeleton Man over on the next platform, and still she waited and stared at everyone who entered the tent. Johnny walked around the Skeleton Man, all stiffness, describing the living skull and the terrible bones, and at last the crowd rustled, turned, led by Johnny, his voice like a battered brass horn as he jumped up onto the platform with her so violently that she jerked aside and licked her red lips.\n",
            "   And now the knot of the blindfold was tied tighter and yet tighter as he bent to whisper:\n",
            "   “Miss him?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but held her head up. The crowd stirred below, like animals in a straw stable.\n",
            "   “Hes not here,” he whispered and locked the electrodes on her arms. She was silent. He whispered again, “Hell never come back.” He fitted the black skullcap over her hair. She trembled. “Afraid?” he wondered quietly. “What of?” He snapped the straps around her ankles. “Dont be afraid. Good clean electricity.” A gasp escaped her lips. He stood up. “I hit him,” he said softly, touching her blindfold. “Hit him so hard I broke his front teeth. Then I knocked him against a wall and hit him again and again—” He Stopped and shouted. “Ladies and gentlemen, witness the most astounding act in carnival history! Here you see a penitentiary electric chair exactly like those used in our biggest prisons. Perfect for the destruction of criminals!” With this last word she fell forward, fingers scratching the wood as he cried, “Before your very eyes, this dear lady will be electrocuted!”\n",
            "   The crowd murmured, and she thought of the tesla transformer under the platform and how Johnny might have fixed it so she got amperage, not voltage. Accident, bad accident Shame. Amperage, not voltage.\n",
            "   She wrenched her right hand free of its leather strap and heard the power switch slam shut as the blue fire seized and shook her, screaming!\n",
            "   The audience applauded and whistled and stomped. Oh she thought wildly, this is good, my death? Great! More applause! More screams!\n",
            "   Out of the black spaces a body fell. “Hit him so hard broke his teeth!” The body jerked. “Then I hit him and hit him again!” The body fell, was picked up, fell again. She screamed high and long as a million unseen mouths stung and bit her. Blue flames seized her heart. The young man” body writhed and exploded in bone shrapnel, flame, and ash\n",
            "   Calmly, Johnny handed her the sword.\n",
            "   “Now,” he said.\n",
            "   Being safe was like a blow to the stomach.\n",
            "   She sobbed, fumbling at the sword, quivering and jerking unable to move. The power hummed and the crowd stuck out their hands, some like spiders, some like birds leaping away wherever the sword sizzled and spat.\n",
            "   The power still lived in her bones as all over the carnival grounds the lights dimmed.\n",
            "   Click. The switch lay in its Off bed.\n",
            "   She sank in upon herself, the sweat running around her nose and her sagging mouth. Gasping, she fought free to pull the blindfold away.\n",
            "   The crowd had gone off to another platform, another miracle, where the Fat Lady called and they obeyed.\n",
            "   Johnnys hand lay on the switch. He dropped his hand, stood there watching her, his dark eyes cold, not flickering.\n",
            "   The tent lights looked dirty, old, yellow, and unclean. She stared blindly at the retreating crowd, Johnny, the tent, the lights. She looked shrunken in the chair. Half of her had poured out through the wires, flushed into the copper cable that fled over the town, leaping from high pole to pole. She lifted her head as if it weighed ninety pounds. The clean light had come, entered into and slid through her, and blasted out again; but it was not the same light anymore. She had changed it; she saw how she had made it. And she shivered because the light was discolored.\n",
            "   Johnnys mouth opened. She didnt hear him at first. He had to repeat what had to be said.\n",
            "   “Youre dead,” he said firmly. And again: “Youre dead.”\n",
            "   And sitting there in the electric chair, trapped by the leather straps, with a wind from the tent flaps playing over her face, evaporating the wetness, staring at him and seeing the dark in his eyes, she gave the only answer it was possible to give.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said, eyes shut. “Oh, yes. I am.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "HOPSCOTCH\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Vinia woke to the sound of a rabbit running down and across an endless moonlit field; but it was only the soft, quick beating of her heart. She lay on the bed for a moment, getting her breath. Now the sound of the running faded and was gone at a great distance. At last she sat up and looked down from her second-story bedroom window and there below, on the long sidewalk, in the faint moonlight before dawn, was the hopscotch.\n",
            "   Late yesterday, some child had chalked it out, immense and endlessly augmented, square upon square, line after line, numeral following numeral. You could not see the end of it. Down the street it built its crazy pattern, 3, 4, 5, on up to 10, then 30, 50, 90, on away to turn far corners. Never in all the childrens world a hopscotch like this! You could Jump forever toward the horizon.\n",
            "   Now in the very early, very quiet morning, her eyes traveled and jumped, paused and hopped, along that presumptuous ladder of chalk-scratches and she heard herself whisper:\n",
            "   “Sixteen.”\n",
            "   But she did not run on from there.\n",
            "   The next square waited, she knew, with the scribbled blue chalk 17, but her mind flung out its arms and balanced, teetering, poised with her numb foot planted across the 1 and the 6, and could go no further.\n",
            "   Trembling, she lay back down.\n",
            "   The room was like the bottom of a cool well all night and she lay in it like a white stone in a well, enjoying it, floating in the dark yet clear element of half dreams and half wakening. She felt the breath move in small jets from her nostrils and she felt the immense sweep of her eyelids shutting and opening again and again. And at last she felt the fever brought into her room by the presence of the sun beyond the hills.\n",
            "   Morning, she thought. It might be a special day. After all, its my birthday. Anything might happen. And I hope it does.\n",
            "   The air moved the white curtains like a summer breath.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   A voice was calling. But it couldnt be a voice. Yet-Vinia raised herself-there it was again.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   She slipped from bed and ran to the window of her high second-story window.\n",
            "   There on the fresh lawn below, calling up to her in the early hour, stood James Conway, no older than she, seventeen, very seriously smiling, waving his hand now as her head appeared.\n",
            "   “Jim, whatre you doing here?” she said, and thought, Does he know what day this is?\n",
            "   “Ive been up an hour already,” he replied. “Im going for a walk, starting early, all day. Want to come along?”\n",
            "   Oh but I couldnt... my folks wont be back till late tonight, Im alone, Im supposed to stay...”\n",
            "   She saw the green hills beyond the town and the roads leading out into summer, leading out into August and rivers and places beyond this town and this house and this room and this particular moment.\n",
            "   “I cant go...” she said faintly.\n",
            "   “I cant hear you!” he protested mildly, smiling up at her under a shielding hand.\n",
            "   “Why did you ask me to walk with you, and not someone else?”\n",
            "   He considered this for a moment. “I dont know,” he admitted. He thought it over again, and gave her his most pleasant and agreeable look. “Because, thats all, just because.”\n",
            "   “Ill be down,” she said.\n",
            "   “Hey!” he said.\n",
            "   But the window was empty.\n",
            "   They stood in the center of the perfect, jeweled lawn, over which one set of prints, hers, had run, leaving marks, and another, his, had walked in great slow strides to meet them. The town was silent as a stopped clock. All the shades were still down.\n",
            "   “My gosh,” said Vinia, “its early. Its crazy-early. Ive never been up this early and out this early in years. Listen to everyone sleeping.”\n",
            "   They listened to the trees and the whiteness of the houses in this early whispering hour, the hour when mice went back to sleep and flowers began untightening their bright fists.\n",
            "   “Which way do we go?”\n",
            "   “Pick a direction.”\n",
            "   Vinia closed her eyes, whirled, and pointed blindly. “Which way am I pointing?”\n",
            "   “North.”\n",
            "   She opened her eyes. “Lefts go north out of town, then. I dont suppose we should.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   And they walked out of town as the sun rose above the hills and the grass burned greener on the lawns.\n",
            "   There was a smell of hot chalk highway, of dust and sky and waters flowing in a creek the color of grapes. The sun was a new lemon. The forest lay ahead with shadows stirring like a million birds under each tree, each bird a leaf-darkness, trembling. At noon, Vinia and James Conway had crossed vast meadows that sounded brisk and starched underfoot. The day had grown warm, as an iced glass of tea grows warm, the frost burning off, left in the sun.\n",
            "   They picked a handful of grapes from a wild barbed-wire vine. Holding them up to the sun, you could see the clear grape thoughts suspended in the dark amber fluid, the little hot seeds of contemplation stored from many afternoons of solitude and plant philosophy. The grapes tasted of fresh, clear water and something that they had saved from the morning dews and the evening rains. They were the warmed-over flesh of April ready now, in August, to pass on their simple gain to any passing stranger. And the lesson was this; sit in the sun, head down, within a prickly vine, in flickery light or open light, and the world will come to you. The sky will come in its time, bringing rain, and the earth will rise through you, from beneath, and make you rich and make you full.\n",
            "   “Have a grape,” said James Conway. “Have two.”\n",
            "   They munched their wet, full mouths.\n",
            "   They sat on the edge of a brook and took off their shoes and let the water cut their feet off to the ankles with an exquisite cold razor.\n",
            "   My feet are gone! thought Vinia. But when she looked, there they were, underwater, living comfortably apart from her, completely acclimated to an amphibious existence.\n",
            "   They ate egg sandwiches Jim had brought with him in a paper sack.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” said Jim, looking at his sandwich before he bit it. “would you mind if I kissed you?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said, after a moment. “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Will you think it over?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Did we come on this picnic just so you could kiss me?” she asked suddenly.\n",
            "   “Oh, dont get me wrong! Its been a swell day! I dont want to spoil it. But if you should decide, later, that its all right for me to kiss you, would you tell me?”\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” she said, starting on her second sandwich, “if I ever decide.”\n",
            "   The rain came as a cool surprise.\n",
            "   It smelled of soda water and limes and oranges and the cleanest, freshest river in the world, made of snow-water, falling from the high, parched sky.\n",
            "   First there had been a motion, as of veils, in the sky. The clouds had enveloped each other softly. A faint breeze had lifted Vinias hair, sighing and evaporating the moisture from her upper lip, and then, as she and Jim began to run, the raindrops fell down all about without touching them and then at last began to touch them, coolly, as they leaped green-moss logs and darted among vast trees into the deepest, muskiest cavern of the forest. The forest sprang up in wet murmurs overhead, every leaf ringing and painted fresh with water.\n",
            "   “This way!” cried Jim.\n",
            "   And they reached a hollow tree so vast that they could squeeze in and be warmly cozy from the rain. They stood together, arms about each other, the first coldness from the rain making them shiver, raindrops on their noses and cheeks, laughing. “Hey!” He gave her brow a lick. “Drinking water!”\n",
            "   “Jim!”\n",
            "   They listened to the rain, the soft envelopment of the world in the velvet clearness of falling water, the whispers in deep grass, evoking odors of old, wet wood and leaves that had lain a hundred years, moldering and sweet.\n",
            "   Then they heard another sound. Above and inside the hollow warm darkness of the tree was a constant humming, like someone in a kitchen, far away, baking and crusting pies contentedly, dipping in sweet sugars and snowing in baking powders, someone in a warm, dim, summer-rainy kitchen making a vast supply of food, happy at it, humming between lips over it.\n",
            "   “Bees, Jim, up there! Bees!”\n",
            "   “Shh!”\n",
            "   Up the channel of moist, warm hollow they saw little yellow flickers. Now the last bees, wettened, were hurrying home from whatever pasture or meadow or field they had covered, dipping by Vinia and Jim, vanishing up the warm flue of summer into hollow dark.\n",
            "   “They wont bother us. Just stand still.”\n",
            "   Jim tightened his arms; Vinia tightened hers. She could smell his breath with the wild tart grapes still on it. And the harder the rain drummed on the tree, the tighter they held, laughing, at last quietly letting their laughter drain away into the sound of the bees home from the far fields. And for a moment, Vinia thought that she and Jim might be caught by a sudden drop of great masses of honey from above, sealing them into this tree forever, enchanted, in amber, to be seen by anyone in the next thousand years who strolled by, while the weather of all ages rained and thundered and turned green outside the tree.\n",
            "   It was so warm, so safe, so protected here, the world did not exist, there was raining silence, in the sunless, forested day.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” whispered Jim, after a while. “May I now?”\n",
            "   His face was very large, near her, larger than any face she had ever seen.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said.\n",
            "   He kissed her.\n",
            "   The rain poured hard on the tree for a full minute while everything was cold outside and everything was tree-warmth and hidden away inside.\n",
            "   It was a very sweet kiss. It was very friendly and comfortably warm and it tasted like apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you rise at night and walk into a dark, warm summer kitchen and drink from a cool tin cup. She had never imagined that a kiss could be so sweet and immensely tender and careful of her. He held her not as he had held her a moment before, hard, to protect her from the green rain weather, but he held her now as if she were a porcelain clock, very carefully and with consideration. His eyes were closed and the lashes were glistening dark; she saw this in the instant she opened her eyes and closed them again.\n",
            "   The rain stopped.\n",
            "   It was a moment before the new silence shocked them into an awareness of the climate beyond their world. Now there was nothing but the suspension of water in all the intricate branches of the forest. Clouds moved away to show the blue sky in great quilted patches.\n",
            "   They looked out at the change with some dismay. They waited for the rain to come back, to keep them, by necessity, in this hollow tree for another minute or an hour. But the sun appeared, shining through upon everything, making the scene quite commonplace again.\n",
            "   They stepped from the hollow tree slowly and stood with their hands out, balancing, finding their way, it seemed, in these woods where the water was drying fast on every limb and leaf.\n",
            "   “I think wed better start walking,” said Vinia. “That way.”\n",
            "   They walked off into the summer afternoon.\n",
            "   They crossed the town limits at sunset and walked hand in hand in the last glowing of the summer day. They had talked very little the rest of the afternoon, and now as they turned down one street after another, they looked at the passing sidewalk under their feet.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” he said at last. “Do you think this is the beginning of something?”\n",
            "   “Oh, gosh, Jim, I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Do you think maybe were in love?”\n",
            "   “Oh, I dont know that either!”\n",
            "   They passed down into the ravine and over the bridge and up the other side to her street.\n",
            "   “Do you think well ever be married?”\n",
            "   “Its too early to tell, isnt it?” she said.\n",
            "   “I guess youre right.” He bit his lip. “Will we go walking again soon?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont know. Lets wait and see, Jim.”\n",
            "   The house was dark, her parents not home yet. They stood on her porch and she shook his hand gravely.\n",
            "   “Thanks, Jim, for a really fine day,” she said.\n",
            "   “Youre welcome,” he said.\n",
            "   They stood there.\n",
            "   Then he turned and walked down the steps and across the dark lawn. At the far edge of lawn he stopped in the shadows and said, “Good night.”\n",
            "   He was almost out of sight, running, when she, in turn, said good night.\n",
            "   In the middle of the night, a sound wakened her.\n",
            "   She half sat up in bed, trying to hear it again. The folks were home, everything was locked and secure, but it hadnt been them. No, this was a special sound. And lying there, looking out at the summer night that had, not long ago, been a summer day, she heard the sound again, and it was a sound of hollowing warmth and moist bark and empty, tunneled tree, the rain outside but comfortable dryness and secretness inside, and it was the sound of bees come home from distant fields, moving upward in the flue of summer into wonderful darkness.\n",
            "   And this sound, she realized, putting her hand up in the summer-night room to touch it, was coming from her drowsy, half-smiling mouth.\n",
            "   Which made her sit bolt upright, and very quietly move downstairs, out through the door, onto the porch, and across the wet-grass lawn to the sidewalk, where the crazed hopscotch chalked itself way off into the future.\n",
            "   Her bare feet hit the first numbers, leaving moist prints up to 10 and 12, thumping, until she stopped at 16, staring down at 17, hesitating, swaying. Then she gritted her teeth, made fists, reared back, and...\n",
            "   Jumped right in the middle of the square 17.\n",
            "   She stood there for a long moment, eyes shut, seeing how it felt.\n",
            "   Then she ran upstairs and lay out on the bed and touched her mouth to see if a summer afternoon was breathing out of it, and listening for that drowsy hum, the golden sound, and it was there.\n",
            "   And it was this sound, eventually, which sang her to sleep.\n",
            "   \n",

            "THE FINNEGAN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   To say that I have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair Finnegan is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final melancholy. Only now, at threescore and ten, can I write these words for an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to unearth my truths or bury my lies.\n",
            "   The facts are these:\n",
            "   Three children went astray and were missed. Their bodies were found in the midst of Chatham Forest and each bore no marks of criminal assassination, but all had suffered their lifeblood to be drained. Only their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes withered by sunlight and no rain.\n",
            "   From the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites. Such myths always pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks. It could only have been a tombyard beast, it was said, that fed on and destroyed three lives and ruined three dozen more.\n",
            "   The children were buried in the most holy ground. Soon after, Sir Robert Merriweather, pretender to the throne of Sherlock Holmes but modestly refusing the claim, moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life. With myself, I might add, to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest.\n",
            "   Sir Robert Merriweather, you say?\n",
            "   Just that. Plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his shut-up house.\n",
            "   Were the doors used? Not one in nine. How had they appeared in Sir Roberts old manse? He had shipped them in, as a collector of doors, from Rio, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, and mid-America. Once collected, he had stashed them, hinged, to be seen from both sides, on the walls of his upper and lower chambers. There he conducted tours of these odd portals for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously overdone, the undersimplified, the rococo, or some First Empire cast aside by Napoleons nephews or seized from Hermann Goering, who had in turn ransacked the Louvre. Others, pelted by Oklahoma dust storms, were jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals buried in the windblown desolations of 1936 America. Name your least favorite door, it was his. Name the best quality, he owned it also, hidden and safe, true beauties behind oblivions portals.\n",
            "   I had come to see his doors, not the deaths. At his behest, which was a command, I had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to find Sir Robert involved not with ten dozen doors, but some great dark door. A mysterious portal, still un-found. And beneath? A tomb.\n",
            "   Sir Robert hurried the grand tour, opening and shutting panels rescued from Peking, long buried near Etna, or filched from Nantucket. But his heart, gone sick, was not in this, what should have been delightful, tour.\n",
            "   He described the spring rains that drenched the country to make things green, only to have people to walk out in that fine weather and one week find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his neck, and in the next weeks, the bodies of the two girls. People shouted for the police and sat drinking in pubs, their faces long and pale, while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the dooms that lay in Chatham Forest.\n",
            "   “Will you come with me,” said Sir Robert at last, “on a very strange, sad picnic?”\n",
            "   “I will,” I said.\n",
            "   So we snapped ourselves in weather-proofs, lugged a hamper of sandwiches and red wine, and plunged into the forest on a drear Sunday.\n",
            "   There was time, as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the trees, to recall what the papers had said about the vanished childrens bloodless flesh, the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times, clueless, while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drum-tight at sunset.\n",
            "   “Rain. Damn. Rain!” Sir Roberts pale face stared up, his gray mustache quivering over his thin mouth. He was sick and brittle and old. “Our picnic will be ruined!”\n",
            "   “Picnic?” I said. “Will our killer join us for eats?”\n",
            "   “I pray to God he will,” Sir Robert said. “Yes, pray to God he will.”\n",
            "   We walked through a land that was now mists, now dim sunlight, now forest, now open glade, until we came into a silent part of the woods, a silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the green moss lay in swards and hillocks. Spring had not yet filled the empty trees. The sun was like an arctic disk, withdrawn, cold, and almost dead.\n",
            "   “This is the place,” said Sir Robert at last.\n",
            "   “Where the children were found?” I inquired.\n",
            "   “Their bodies empty as empty can be.”\n",
            "   I looked at the glade and thought of the children and the people who had stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to whisper and touch and go away, lost.\n",
            "   “The murderer was never apprehended?”\n",
            "   “Not this clever fellow. How observant are you?” asked Sir Robert.\n",
            "   “What do you want observed?”\n",
            "   “Theres the catch. The police slipped up. They were stupidly anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess, seeking a killer with two arms, two legs, a suit of clothes, and a knife. So hypnotized with their human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious unbelievable fact about this place. So!”\n",
            "   He gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth.\n",
            "   Something happened. I stared at the ground. “Do that again,” I whispered.\n",
            "   “You saw it?”\n",
            "   “I thought I saw a small trapdoor open and shut. May I have your cane?”\n",
            "   He gave me the cane. I tapped the ground. It happened again.\n",
            "   “A spider!” I cried. “Gone! God, how quick!”\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” Sir Robert muttered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You know the old saying: in again, out again, Finnegan. Here.”\n",
            "   With his penknife, Sir Robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of earth, breaking off bits to show me the tunnel. The spider, in panic, leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground.\n",
            "   Sir Robert handed me the tunnel. “Like gray velvet. Feel. A model builder, that small chap. A tiny shelter, camouflaged, and him alert. He could hear a fly walk. Then pounce out, seize, pop back, slam the lid!”\n",
            "   “I didnt know you loved Nature.”\n",
            "   “Loathe it. But this wee chap, theres much we share. Doors. Hinges. Wouldnt consider other arachnids. But my love of portals drew me to study this incredible carpenter.” Sir Robert worked the trap on its cobweb hinges. “What craftsmanship! And it all ties to the tragedies!”\n",
            "   “The murdered children?”\n",
            "   Sir Robert nodded. “Notice any special thing about this forest?”\n",
            "   “Its too quiet.”\n",
            "   “Quiet!” Sir Robert smiled weakly. “Vast quantities of silence. No familiar birds, beetles, crickets, toads. Not a rustle or stir. The police didnt notice. Why should they? But it was this absence of sound and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders.”\n",
            "   He toyed with the amazing structure in his hands.\n",
            "   “What would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough, in a hideout big enough, so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound, be seized, and vanish with a soft thud below. How say you?” Sir Robert stared at the trees. “Poppycock and bilge? Yet, why not? Evolution, selection, growth, mutations, and-pfft!”\n",
            "   Again he tapped with his cane. A trapdoor flew open, shut.\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” he said.\n",
            "   The sky darkened.\n",
            "   “Rain!” Casting a cold gray eye at the clouds, he stretched his frail hand to touch the showers. “Damn! Arachnids hate rain. And so will our huge dark Finnegan.”\n",
            "   “Finnegan!” I cried irritably.\n",
            "   “I believe in him, yes.”\n",
            "   “A spider larger than a child?!”\n",
            "   “Twice as large.”\n",
            "   The cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us. “Lord, I hate to leave. Quick, before we go. Here.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raked away the old leaves with his cane, revealing two globular gray-brown objects.\n",
            "   “What are they?” I bent. “Old cannonballs?”\n",
            "   “No.” He cracked the grayish globes. “Soil, through and through.”\n",
            "   I touched the crumbled bits.\n",
            "   “Our Finnegan excavates,” said Sir Robert. “To make his tunnel. With his large rakelike chelicerae he dislodges soil, works it into a ball, carries it in his jaws, and drops it beyond his hole.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm. “Normal balls evicted from a tiny trapdoor tunnel. Toy-size.” He knocked his cane on the huge globes at our feet. “Explain those!”\n",
            "   I laughed. “The children mustve made them with mud!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense!” cried Sir Robert irritably, glaring about at trees and earth. “By God, somewhere, our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid. We might be standing on it. Christ, dont stare! His door has beveled rims. Some architect, this Finnegan. A genius at camouflage.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raved on and on, describing the dark earth, the arachnid, its fiddling legs, its hungry mouth, as the wind roared and the trees shook.\n",
            "   Suddenly, Sir Robert flung up his cane.\n",
            "   “No!” he cried.\n",
            "   I had no time to turn. My flesh froze, my heart stopped.\n",
            "   Something snatched my spine.\n",
            "   I thought I heard a huge bottle uncorked, a lid sprung. Then this monstrous thing crawled down my back.\n",
            "   “Here!” cried Sir Robert. “Now!”\n",
            "   He struck with his cane. I fell, dead weight. He thrust the thing from my spine. He lifted it.\n",
            "   The wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it onto my back.\n",
            "   Weakly, I tried to rise, shivering. “Silly,” I said a dozen times. “Silly. Damn awful silly!”\n",
            "   “Silly, no. Brandy, yes!” said Sir Robert. “Brandy?”\n",
            "   The sky was very black now. The rain swarmed over us.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Door after door after door, and at last into Sir Roberts country house study. A warm, rich room, where a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth. We devoured our sandwiches, waiting for the rain to cease. Sir Robert estimated that it would stop by eight oclock, when, by moonlight, we might return, ever so reluctantly, to Chatham Forest. I remembered the fallen branch, its spidering touch, and drank both wine and brandy.\n",
            "   “The silence in the forest,” said Sir Robert, finishing his meal. “What murderer could achieve such a silence?”\n",
            "   “An insanely clever man with a series of baited, poisoned traps, with liberal quantities of insecticide, might kill off every bird, every rabbit, every insect,” I said.\n",
            "   “Why should he do that?”\n",
            "   “To convince us that there is a large spider nearby. To perfect his act.”\n",
            "   “We are the only ones who have noticed this silence; the police did not. Why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing?”\n",
            "   “Why is a murderer? you might well ask.”\n",
            "   “I am not convinced.” Sir Robert topped his food with wine. “This creature, with a voracious mouth, has cleansed the forest. With nothing left, he seized the children. The silence, the murders, the prevalence of trapdoor spiders, the large earth balls, it all fits.”\n",
            "   Sir Roberts fingers crawled about the desktop, quite like a washed, manicured spider in itself. He made a cup of his frail hands, held them up.\n",
            "   “At the bottom of a spiders burrow is a dustbin into which drop insect remnants on which the spider has dined. Imagine the dustbin of our Grand Finnegan!”\n",
            "   I imagined. I visioned a Great Legged thing fastened to its dark lid under the forest and a child running, singing in the half-light. A brisk insucked whisk of air, the song cut short, then nothing but an empty glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid, and beneath the dark earth the spider, fiddling, cabling, spinning the stunned child in its silently orchestrating legs.\n",
            "   What would the dustbin of such an incredible spider resemble? What the remnants of many banquets? I shuddered.\n",
            "   “Rains letting up.” Sir Robert nodded his approval. “Back to the forest. Ive mapped the damned place for weeks. All the bodies were found in one half-open glade. Thats where the assassin, if it was a man, arrives! Or where the unnatural silk-spinning, earth-tunneling architect of special doors abides his tomb.”\n",
            "   “Must I hear all this?” I protested.\n",
            "   “Listen more.” Sir Robert downed the last of his burgundy. “The poor childrens prolapsed corpses were found at thirteen-day intervals. Which means that every two weeks our loathsome eight-legged hide-and-seeker must feed. Tonight is the fourteenth night after the last child was found, nothing but skin. Tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh. So! Within the hour, I shall introduce you to Finnegan the great and horrible!”\n",
            "   “All of which,” I said, “makes me want to drink.”\n",
            "   “Here I go.” Sir Robert stepped through one of his Louis the Fourteenth portals. “To find the last and final and most awful door in all my life. You will follow.”\n",
            "   Damn, yes! I followed.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The sun had set, the rain was gone, and the clouds cleared off to show a cold and troubled moon. We moved in our own silence and the silence of the exhausted paths and glades while Sir Robert handed me a small silver pistol.\n",
            "   “Not that that would help. Killing an outsize arachnid is sticky. Hard to know where to fire the first shot. If you miss, therell be no time for a second. Damned things, large or small, move in the instant!”\n",
            "   “Thanks.” I took the weapon. “I need a drink.”\n",
            "   “Done.” Sir Robert handed me a silver brandy flask. “Drink as needed.”\n",
            "   I drank. “What about you?”\n",
            "   “I have my own special flask.” Sir Robert lifted it. “For the right time.”\n",
            "   “Why wait?”\n",
            "   “I must surprise the beast and mustnt be drunk at the encounter. Four seconds before the thing grabs me, I will imbibe of this dear Napoleon stuff, spiced with a rude surprise.\n",
            "   “Surprise?”\n",
            "   “Ah, wait. Youll see. So will this dark thief of life. Now, dear sir, here we part company. I this way, you yonder. Do you mind?”\n",
            "   “Mind when Im scared gutless? Whats that?”\n",
            "   “Here. If I should vanish.” He handed me a sealed letter. “Read it aloud to the constabulary. It will help them locate me and Finnegan, lost and found.”\n",
            "   “Please, no details. I feel like a damned fool following you while Finnegan, if he exists, is underfoot snug and warm, saying, “Ah, those idiots above running about, freezing. I think Ill let them freeze. ““\n",
            "   “One hopes not. Get away now. If we walk together, he wont jump up. Alone, hell peer out the merest crack, glom the scene with a huge bright eye, flip down again, ssst, and one of us gone to darkness.”\n",
            "   “Not me, please. Not me.”\n",
            "   We walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in the half moonlight.\n",
            "   “Are you there?” called Sir Robert from half the world away in leafy dark.\n",
            "   “I wish I werent,” I yelled back.\n",
            "   “Onward!” cried Sir Robert. “Dont lose sight of me. Move closer. Were near on the site. I can intuit, I almost feel—”\n",
            "   As a final cloud shifted, moonlight glowed brilliantly to show Sir Robert waving his arms about like antennae, eyes half shut, gasping with expectation.\n",
            "   “Closer, closer,” I heard him exhale. “Near on. Be still. Perhaps...\n",
            "   He froze in place. There” was something in his aspect that made me want to leap, race, and yank him off the turf he had chosen.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert, oh, God!” I cried. “Run!”\n",
            "   He froze. One hand and arm orchestrated the air, feeling, probing, while his other hand delved, brought forth his silver-coated flask of brandy. He held it high in the moonlight, a toast to doom. Then, afflicted with need, he took one, two, three, my God, four incredible swigs!\n",
            "   Arms out, balancing the wind, tilting his head back, laughing like a boy, he swigged the last of his mysterious drink.\n",
            "   “All right, Finnegan, below and beneath!” he cried. “Come get me!”\n",
            "   He stomped his foot.\n",
            "   Cried out victorious.\n",
            "   And vanished.\n",
            "   It was all over in a second.\n",
            "   A flicker, a blur, a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a whisper, a suction, and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut.\n",
            "   The glade was empty.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert. Quick!”\n",
            "   But there was no one to quicken.\n",
            "   Not thinking that I might be snatched and vanished, I lurched to the spot where Sir Robert had drunk his wild toast.\n",
            "   I stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles, dry grass, and earth.\n",
            "   I must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog, then fell to my knees, fearless, to dig for lids, for tunneled tombs where a voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves, binding and mummifying a thing that had been my friend. This is his final door, I thought insanely, crying the name of my friend.\n",
            "   I found only his pipe, cane, and empty brandy flask, flung down when he had escaped night, life, everything.\n",
            "   Swaying up, I fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering earth, a dumb thing gone stupid as I finished and staggered over his instant graveyard, his locked-in tomb, listening for muffled screams, shrieks, cries, but heard none. I ran in circles, with no ammunition save my weeping shouts. I would have stayed all night, but a downpour of leaves, a great spidering flourish of broken branches, fell to panic and suffer my heart. I fled, still calling his name to a silence lidded by clouds that hid the moon.\n",
            "   At his estate, I beat on the door, wailing, yanking, until I recalled: it opened inward, it was unlocked.\n",
            "   Alone in the library, with only liquor to help me live, I read the letter that Sir Robert had left behind:\n",
            "   \n",
            "   My dear Douglas:\n",
            "   I am old and have seen much but am not mad. Finnegan exists. My chemist had provided me with a sure poison that I will mix in my brandy for our walk. I will drink all. Finnegan, not knowing me as a poisoned morsel will give me a swift invite. Now you see me, now you dont. I will then be the weapon of his death, minutes after my own. I do not think there is another outsize nightmare like him on earth. Once gone, thats the end.\n",
            "   Being old, I am immensely curious. I fear not death, for my physicians tell me that f no accidents kill me, cancer will.\n",
            "   I thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin. But then Id never know where he was or if he really existed. Finnegan would die unseen in his monstrous closet, and I never the wiser. This way, for one victorious moment, I will know. Fear for me. Envy me. Pray for me. Sorry to abandon you without farewells. Dear friend, carry on.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   I folded the letter and wept.\n",
            "   No more was ever heard of him.\n",
            "   Some say Sir Robert killed himself, an actor in his own melodrama, and that one day we shall unearth his brooding, lost, and Gothic body and that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with doors and hinges, and more doors, led him, crazed, to study this one species of spider, and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in history, an insane burrow into which he popped to die, before my eyes, thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible Finnegan.\n",
            "   But I have found no burrow. I do not believe a man could construct such a pit, even given Sir Roberts overwhelming passion for doors.\n",

            "THAT WOMAN ON THE LAWN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Very late at night he heard the weeping on the lawn in front of his house. It was the sound of a woman crying. By its sound he knew it was not a girl or a mature woman, but the crying of someone eighteen or nineteen years old. It went on, then faded and stopped, and again started up, now moving this way or that on the late-summer wind.\n",
            "   He lay in bed listening to it until it made his eyes fill with tears. He turned over, shut his eyes, let the tears fall, but could not stop the sound. Why should a young woman be weeping long after midnight out there?\n",
            "   He sat up and the weeping stopped.\n",
            "   At the window, he looked down. The lawn was empty but covered with dew. There was a trail of footsteps across the lawn to the middle where someone had stood turning, and another trail going off toward the garden around the house.\n",
            "   The moon stood full in the sky and filled the lawn with its light, but there was no more sadness and only the footprints there.\n",
            "   He stepped back from the window, suddenly chilled, and went down to heat and drink a cup of chocolate.\n",
            "   He did not think of the weeping again until dusk the next day, and even then thought that it must be some woman from a house nearby, unhappy with life, perhaps locked out and in need of a place to let her sadness go.\n",
            "   Yet...?\n",
            "   As the twilight deepened, coming home he found himself hurrying from the bus, at a steady pace which astonished him. Why, why all this?\n",
            "   Idiot, he thought. A woman unseen weeps under your window, and here at sunset the next day, you almost run.\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, but her voice!\n",
            "   Was it beautiful, then?\n",
            "   No. Only familiar.\n",
            "   Where had he heard such a voice before, wordless in crying?\n",
            "   Who could he ask, living in an empty house from which his parents had vanished long ago?\n",
            "   He turned in at his front lawn and stood still, his eyes shadowed.\n",
            "   What had he expected? That whoever she was would be waiting here? Was he that lonely that a single voice long after midnight roused all his senses?\n",
            "   No. Simply put: he must know who the crying woman was.\n",
            "   And he was certain she would return tonight as he slept.\n",
            "   He went to bed at eleven, and awoke at three, panicked that he had missed a miracle. Lightning had destroyed a nearby town or an earthquake had shaken half the world to dust, and he had slept through it!\n",
            "   Fool! he thought, and slung back the covers and moved to the window, to see that indeed he had overslept.\n",
            "   For there on the lawn were the delicate footprints.\n",
            "   And he hadnt even heard the weeping!\n",
            "   He would have gone out to kneel in the grass, but at that moment a police car motored slowly by, looking at nothing and the night.\n",
            "   How could he run to prowl, to probe, to touch the grass if that car came by again? What doing? Picking clover blossoms? Weeding dandelions? What, what?\n",
            "   His bones cracked with indecision. He would go down, he would not.\n",
            "   Already the memory of that terrible weeping faded the more he tried to make it clear. If he missed her one more night, the memory itself might be gone.\n",
            "   Behind him, in his room, the alarm clock rang. Damn! he thought. What time did I set it for? He shut off the alarm and sat on his bed, rocking gently, waiting, eyes shut, listening.\n",
            "   The wind shifted. The tree just outside the window whispered and stirred.\n",
            "   He opened his eyes and leaned forward. From far off, coming near, and now down below, the quiet sound of a woman weeping.\n",
            "   She had come back to his lawn and was not forever lost. Be very quiet, he thought.\n",
            "   And the sounds she made came up on the wind through the blowing curtains into his room.\n",
            "   Careful now. Careful but quick.\n",
            "   He moved to the window and looked down.\n",
            "   In the middle of the lawn she stood and wept, her hair long and dark on her shoulders, her face bright with tears.\n",
            "   And there was something in the way her hands trembled at her sides, the way her hair moved quietly in the wind, that shook him so that he almost fell.\n",
            "   He knew her and yet did not. He had seen her before, but had never seen.\n",
            "   Turn your head, he thought.\n",
            "   Almost as if hearing this, the young woman sank to her knees to half kneel on the grass, letting the wind comb her hair, head down and weeping so steadily and bitterly that he wanted to cry out: Oh, no! It kills my heart!\n",
            "   And as if she had heard, quite suddenly her head lifted, her weeping grew less as she looked up at the moon, so that he saw her face.\n",
            "   And it was indeed a face seen somewhere once, but where?\n",
            "   A tear fell. She blinked.\n",
            "   It was like the blinking of a camera and a picture taken.\n",
            "   “God save me!” he whispered. “No!”\n",
            "   He whirled and stumbled toward the closet to seize down an avalanche of boxes and albums. In the dark he scrabbled, then pulled on the closet light, tossed aside six albums until finally, dragging another forth and riffling pages, he gave a cry, stopped, and held a photo close, then turned and moved blindly to the window.\n",
            "   There he stared down at the lawn and then at the photograph, very old, very yellowed with age.\n",
            "   Yes, yes, the same! The image struck his eyes and then his heart. His whole body shook, made an immense pulsation, as he leaned at the album, leaned on the window frame, and almost shouted:\n",
            "   You! How dare you come back! How dare you be young! How dare you be what? A girl untouched, wandering late on my lawn!? You were never that young! Never! Damn, oh, damn your warm blood, damn your wild soul!\n",
            "   But this he did not shout or say.\n",
            "   For something in his eyes, like a beacon, must have flashed.\n",
            "   The crying of the young woman on the lawn stopped.\n",
            "   She looked up.\n",
            "   At which instant the album fell from his fingers, through the burst-wide screen, and down like a dark bird fluttering to strike the earth.\n",
            "   The young man gave a muted cry, whirled, and ran. “No, no!” he cried aloud. “I didnt mean-come back!” He was down the stairs and out on the porch in a matter of seconds. The door slammed behind him like a gunshot. The explosion nailed him to the rail, half down to the lawn, where there was nothing to be seen but footprints. Either way, up the street lay empty sidewalks and shadows under trees. A radio played off in an upstairs window in a house behind trees. A car passed, murmuring, at a far intersection.\n",
            "   “Wait,” he whispered. “Come back. I shouldnt have said—”\n",
            "   He stopped. He had said nothing, but only thought it. But his outrage, his jealousy?\n",
            "   She had felt that. She had somehow heard. And now...?\n",
            "   Shell never come back, he thought. Oh God!\n",
            "   He sat on the porch steps for a while, quietly biting his knuckle.\n",
            "   At three in the morning, in bed, he thought he heard a sigh and soft footsteps in grass, and waited. The photo album lay closed on the floor. Even though it lay shut, he could see and know her face. And it was utterly impossible, utterly insane.\n",
            "   His last thought before sleep was: ghost.\n",
            "   The strangest ghost that ever walked.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone dead.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone who died very old.\n",
            "   But somehow come back not as her old self.\n",
            "   But a ghost that was somehow young.\n",
            "   Werent ghosts always, when they returned, the same age as when they died?\n",
            "   No.\n",
            "   Not this one anyway.\n",
            "   “Why...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   And dream took over the whisper.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One night passed and then another and another, and there was nothing on the lawn but the light of a moon that changed its face from outright stare to half grimace.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   The first night a more than ordinarily casual cat crossed the yard at two a. m.\n",
            "   The second night a dog trotted by, wearing his tongue half out of his mouth like a loosely tied red cravat, smiling at trees.\n",
            "   The third night a spider spent from twelve-twenty-five until four a. m. building a baroque clockface on the air between lawn and trees, which a bird broke in passing at dawn.\n",
            "   He slept most of Sunday and awoke with a fever that was not an illness at dusk.\n",
            "   Late in the twilight of the fifth day, the color of the sky somehow promised her return, as did the way the wind leaned against the trees and the look of the moon when it finally rose to set the scene.\n",
            "   “All right,” he said, half aloud. “Now.” But at midnight, nothing.\n",
            "   “Come on,” he whispered.\n",
            "   One oclock, nothing.\n",
            "   You must, he thought.\n",
            "   No, you will.\n",
            "   He slept for ten minutes and woke suddenly at two-ten, knowing that when he went to the window—\n",
            "   She would be there.\n",
            "   She was.\n",
            "   At first, he didnt see her, and groaned, and then, in the shadow of the great oak far out on the edge of the lawn, he saw something move, and one foot came out, and she took a step and stood very still.\n",
            "   He held his breath, quieted his heart, told himself to turn, walk, and take each step down with precision, numbering them, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, moving in darkness with no rush, six, five, four, and at last one. He opened the front screen door with only a whisper, and was on the porch without frightening what might be out beyond waiting for him.\n",
            "   Quietly, he moved down the porch steps to the edge of the lawn, like one who stands on the rim of a pond. Out in the center of that pond, the young woman stood, trapped like someone on thin ice that might at any moment break and drop her through.\n",
            "   She did not see him. And then... \n",
            "   She did a thing that was a signal. Tonight her hair was fixed in a knot at the back of her head. She lifted her white arms in a gesture and with one touch of her fingers, a touch of snow, loosened her hair.\n",
            "   It fell in a dark banner, to blow and repattern itself across her shoulders, which trembled with their shadows.\n",
            "   The wind stirred her hair in the night and moved it about her face and on her uplifted hands.\n",
            "   The shadows laid down by the moon under every tree leaned as if called by the motion.\n",
            "   The entire world shifted in its sleep.\n",
            "   The wind blew as the young woman waited.\n",
            "   But no footsteps sounded along the white sidewalks. No front doors opened far down the street. No windows were raised. No motion caused front porches to creak and shift.\n",
            "   He took another step out onto the small meadow of night.\n",
            "   “Who are you-?” she gasped, and stepped back. “No, no,” he said softly. “Its all right.” Another trembling had taken over her body. Where before it had been some hope, some anticipation, now it was fear. One hand stopped her hair from blowing; the other half shielded her face.\n",
            "   “Ill stand right here,” he said. “Believe me. “” She waited a long while, staring at him until her shoulders\n",
            "   relaxed and the lines around her mouth vanished. Her whole body sensed the truth of his words.\n",
            "   “I dont understand,” she said.\n",
            "   “I dont either.” “What are you doing here?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” “What am I doing here?”\n",
            "   “You came to meet someone,” he said.\n",
            "   “Did I?”\n",
            "   The town clock struck three in the morning far away. She listened to it, her face shadowed by the sound.\n",
            "   “But its so late. People dont walk around late on front lawns!”\n",
            "   “They do if they must,” he said.\n",
            "   “But why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe we can find out, if we talk.”\n",
            "   “About what, what?!”\n",
            "   “About why youre here. If we talk long enough, we may know. I know why Im here, of course. I heard you crying.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Im so ashamed.”\n",
            "   “Dont be. Why are people ashamed of tears? I cry often. Then I start laughing. But the crying must come first. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “What a strange man you are.”\n",
            "   Her hand fell away from her hair. Her other hand moved away so her face was illuminated by a small and growing curiosity.\n",
            "   “I thought I was the only one who knew about crying,” she said.\n",
            "   “Everyone thinks that. Its one of those little secrets we keep from each other. Show me a serious man and Ill show you a man who has never wept. Show me a madman and Ill show you a man who dried his tears a long time ago. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “I think Im done,” she said.\n",
            "   “Any time, start over.”\n",
            "   She burst out a tiny laugh. “Oh, you are strange. Who are you?”\n",
            "   “Well come to that.”\n",
            "   She peered across the lawn at his hands, his face, his mouth, and then at his eyes.\n",
            "   “Oh, I know you. But from where?!”\n",
            "   “That would spoil it. You wouldnt believe, anyway.”\n",
            "   “I would!”\n",
            "   Now it was his turn to laugh quietly. “Youre very young.”\n",
            "   “No, nineteen! Ancient!”\n",
            "   “Girls, by the time they go from twelve to nineteen, are full of years, yes. I dont know; but it must be so. Now, please, why are you out here in the middle of the night?”\n",
            "   “I—” She shut her eyes to think in on it. “Im waiting.”\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   “And Im sad.”\n",
            "   “Its the waiting that makes you sad, yes?”\n",
            "   “I think, no, yes, no.”\n",
            "   “And you dont quite know what youre waiting for?”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wish I could be sure. All of mes waiting. I dont know, all of me. I dont understand. Im impossible!”\n",
            "   “No, youre everyone that ever grew up too fast and wanted too much. I think girls, women, like you have slipped out at night since time began. If it wasnt here in Green Town, it was in Cairo or Alexandria or Rome or Paris in summer, anywhere there was a private place and late hours and no one to see, so they just rose up and out, as if someone had called their name—”\n",
            "   “I was called, yes! Thats it! Someone did call my name! Its true. How did you know? Was it you!”\n",
            "   “No. But someone we both know. Youll know his name when you go back to bed tonight, wherever that is.”\n",
            "   “Why, in that house, behind you,” she said. “Thats my house. I was born in it.”\n",
            "   “Well”-he laughed-“so was I.”\n",
            "   “You? How can that be? Are you sure?”\n",
            "   “Yes. Anyway, you heard someone calling. You had to come out—”\n",
            "   “I did. Many nights now. But, always, no ones here. They must be there, or why would I hear them?”\n",
            "   “One day therell be someone to fit the voice.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont joke with me!”\n",
            "   “Im not. Believe. There will be. Thats what all those other women heard in other years and places, middle of summer, dead of winter, go out and risk cold, stand warm in snow banks, and listen and look for strange footprints on the midnight snow, and only an old dog trotting by, all smiles. Damn, damn.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes, damn, damn.” And her smile showed for a moment, even as the moon came out of the clouds and went away. “Isnt it silly?”\n",
            "   “No. Men do the same. They take long walks when theyre sixteen, seventeen. They dont stand on lawns, waiting, no. But, my God, how they walk! Miles and miles from midnight until dawn and come home exhausted and explode and die in bed.”\n",
            "   “What a shame that those who stand and wait and those who walk all night cant—”\n",
            "   “Meet?”\n",
            "   “Yes; dont you think its a shame?”\n",
            "   “They do, finally.”\n",
            "   “Oh, no, I shall never meet anyone. Im old and ugly and terrible and I dont know how many nights Ive heard that voice making me come here and theres nothing and I just want to die.”\n",
            "   “Oh, lovely young girl,” he said gently. “Dont die. The cavalry is on its way. You will be saved.”\n",
            "   There was such certainty in his voice that it made her glance up again, for she had been looking at her hands and her own soul in her hands.\n",
            "   “You know, dont you?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",

            "   “Oh, please dont tell me that if it isnt true!” Her voice trembled. Tears flashed again in her eyes. She half raised her arms again in defense.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt dream to hurt you. I only came to tell.” The town clock struck again in the deep morning. “Its late,” she said.\n",
            "   “Very late. Get along, now.” “Is that all youre going to say?” “You dont need to know any more.” The last echoes of the great clock faded.\n",
            "   “How strange,” she murmured. “The ghost of a question, the ghost of an answer.”\n",
            "   “What better ghosts can there be?”\n",
            "   “None that I ever heard of. Were twins.”\n",
            "   “Far nearer than you think.”\n",
            "   She took a step, looked down, and gasped with delight. “Look, oh, look. I can move!”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “What was it you said, boys walk all night, miles and miles?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “I could go back in, but I cant sleep now. I must walk, too.”\n",
            "   “Do that,” he said gently.\n",
            "   “But where shall I go?”\n",
            "   “Why,” he said, and he suddenly knew. He knew where to send her and was suddenly angry with himself for knowing, angry with her for asking. A burst of jealousy welled in him. He wanted to race down the street to a certain house where a certain young man lived in another year and break the window, burn the roof. And yet, oh, yet, if he did that!?\n",
            "   “Yes?” she said, for he had kept her waiting.\n",
            "   Now, he thought, you must tell her. Theres no escape.\n",
            "   For if you dont tell her, angry fool, you yourself will never be born.\n",
            "   A wild laugh burst from his mouth, a laugh that accepted the entire night and time and all his crazed thinking.\n",
            "   “So you want to know where to go?” he said at last.\n",
            "   \t“Oh, yes!”\n",
            "   He nodded his head. “Up to that corner, four blocks to the right, one block to the left.”\n",
            "   She repeated it quickly. “And the final number?!”\n",
            "   “Eleven Green Park.”\n",
            "   “Oh, thank you, thank you!” She ran a few steps, then stopped, bewildered. Her hands were helpless at her throat. Her mouth trembled. “Silly. I hate to leave.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “Why, because... Im afraid Ill never see you again!”\n",
            "   “You will. Three years from now.”\n",
            "   “Are you sure?”\n",
            "   “I wont look quite the same. But itll be me. And youll know me forever.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Im glad for that. Your face is familiar. I somehow know you well.”\n",
            "   She began to walk slowly, looking over at him as he stood near the porch of the house.\n",
            "   “Thanks,” she said. “Youve saved my life.”\n",
            "   “And my own along with it.”\n",
            "   The shadows of a tree fell across her face, touched her cheeks, moved in her eyes.\n",
            "   “Oh, Lord! Girls lie in bed nights listing the names for their future children. Silly. Joe. John. Christopher. Samuel. Stephen. And right now, Will.” She touched the gentle rise of her stomach, then lifted her hand out halfway to point to him in the night. “Is your name Will?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Tears absolutely burst from her eyes. He wept with her.\n",
            "   “Oh, thats fine, fine,” she said at last. “I can go now. I wont be out here on the lawn anymore. Thank God, thank you. Good night.”\n",
            "   She went away into the shadows across the lawn and along the sidewalk down the street. At the far corner he saw her turn and wave and walk away.\n",
            "   “Good night,” he said quietly.\n",
            "   I am not born yet, he thought, or she has been dead many years, which is it? which?\n",
            "   The moon sailed into clouds.\n",
            "   The motion touched him to step, walk, go up the porch stairs, wait, look out at the lawn, go inside, shut the door.\n",
            "   A wind shook the trees.\n",
            "   The moon came out again and looked upon a lawn where two sets of footprints, one going one way, one going another in the dew, slowly, slowly, as the night continued, vanished.\n",
            "   By the time the moon had gone down the sky there was only an empty lawn and no sign, and much dew.\n",

            "   Joshua Enderby awoke in the middle of the night because e felt someones fingers at his throat.\n",
            "   In the rich darkness above him he sensed but could not see his wifes frail, skelatinous weight seated on his chest while she dabbled and clenched tremblingly again and again at his neck.\n",
            "   He opened his eyes wide. He realized what she was trying to do. It was so ridiculous he almost cried out with laughter!\n",
            "   His rickety, jaundiced, eighty-five-year-old wife was trying to strangle him!\n",
            "   She panted forth a rum-and-bitters smell as she perched there, toppling like a drunken moth, tinkering away as if he were a toy. She sighed irritably and her skinny fingers began to swear as she gasped, “Why dont you, oh, why don “t you?”\n",
            "   Why dont I what? he wondered idly, lying there. He swallowed and this faint action of his Adams apple dislodged her feeble clutch. Why dont I die; is that it? he cried silently. He lay another few moments, wondering if shed gain strength enough to do him in. She didnt.\n",
            "   Should he snap on the light to confront her? Wouldnt she look a silly ass, a skinny chicken aloft sidesaddle on her hated husbands amazed body, and him laughing?\n",
            "   Joshua Enderby groaned and yawned. “Missy?”\n",
            "   Her hands froze on his collarbone.\n",
            "   “Will you—” He turned, pretending half sleep. “Will you-please” “-he yawned—” “move to your side—of the bed? Eh? Good girl.”\n",
            "   Missy moved off in the dark. He heard ice tinkle. She was having another shot of rum.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   At noon the next day, enjoying the weather and waiting for luncheon guests to arrive, old Joshua and Missy traded drinks in the garden pavilion. He handed her Dubonnet; she gave him sherry.\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence as both eyed the stuff and hesitated to sip. He handled his glass in such a way that his large white diamond ring sparked and glittered on his palsied hand. Its light made him flinch and at last he gathered his phlegm.\n",
            "   “Missy,” he said. “You havent long to live, you know.” Missy was hidden behind jonquils in a crystal bowl and now peered out at her mummified husband. Both perceived that the others hands shook. She wore a cobalt dress, heavily iced with luncheon jewels, little glittery planets under each ear, a scarlet design for a mouth. The ancient whore of Babylon, he thought dryly.\n",
            "   “How odd, my dear, how very odd,” Missy said with a polite scrape of her voice. “Why, only last night—”\n",
            "   “You were thinking of me?”\n",
            "   “We must talk.”\n",
            "   “Yes, we must.” He leaned like a wax mannequin in his chair. “No rush. But if I do you in, or if you do me in (it matters not which), lets protect each other, yes? Oh, dont look at me in amaze, my dear. I was perfectly aware of your little gallup last night on my ribs, fumbling with my esophagus, feeling the tumblers click, or whatever.”\n",
            "   “Dear me.” Blood rose in Missys powdery cheeks. “Were you awake all during? Im mortified. I think I shall have to go lie down.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense.” Joshua stopped her. “If I die, you should be shielded so no onell accuse you. Same with me, if you die. Why go to all the trouble of trying to-eliminate-each other if it just means a gallows-drop or a french fry.”\n",
            "   “Logical enough,” she agreed.\n",
            "   “I suggest a-a series of mash notes to each other. Umm, lavish displays of sentiment before friends, gifts, et cetera. Ill run up bills for flowers, diamond bracelets. You purchase fine leather wallets and gold-ferruled canes for me.”\n",
            "   “You have a head for things, I must say,” she admitted.\n",
            "   “It will help allay suspicion if we appear madly, anciently in love.”\n",
            "   “You know,” she said tiredly, “it doesnt matter, Joshua, which of us dies first, except that Im very old and would like to do one thing right in my life. Ive always been such a dilettante. Ive never liked you. Loved you, yes, but thats ten million years back. You never were a friend. If it werent for the children—”\n",
            "   “Motives are bilge,” he said. “We are two querulous old pots with nothing to do but kick off, and make a circus of that. But how much better the dying game if we write a few rules, act it neatly, with no one the wiser. How long has this assassination plot of yours been active?”\n",
            "   She beamed. “Remember the opera last week? You slipped from the curb? That car almost nailed you?”\n",
            "   “Good Lord.” He laughed. “I thought someone shoved both of us!” He leaned forward, chuckling. “Okay. When you fell in the bath last month? I greased the tub!”\n",
            "   Unthinkingly, she gasped, drank part of her Dubonnet, then froze.\n",
            "   Reading her mind, he stared at his own drink.\n",
            "   “This isnt poisoned, by any chance?” He sniffed his glass. “Dont be silly,” she replied, touching her Dubonnet with a lizards doubtful tongue. “Theyd find the residue in whats left of your stomach. Just be sure you double-check your shower tonight. I have kited the temperature, which might bring on a seizure.”\n",
            "   “You didnt!” he scoffed.\n",
            "   “Ive thought about it,” she confessed.\n",
            "   The front-door chimes rang, but not with their usual joy, sounding more funereal. Nonsense! Joshua thought. Bosh! thought Missy, then brightened:\n",
            "   “We have forgotten our luncheon guest! Thats the Gowrys! Hes a bore, but be nice! Fix your collar.”\n",
            "   “Its damned tight. Too much starch. One more plot to strangle me?”\n",
            "   “I wish I had thought of that. Double time, now!”\n",
            "   And they marched, arm in arm, with idiot laughter, off to meet the half-forgotten Gowrys.\n",
            "   Cocktails were served. The old relics sat side by side, hands laced like school chums, laughing with weak heartiness at Gowrys dire jokes. They leaned forward to show him their porcelain smiles, saying, “Oh, thats a good one!” loudly, and, softly, sotto voce; to each other: “Thought of anything new?” “Electric razor in your bath?” “Not bad, not bad!”\n",
            "   “And then Pat said to Mike!” cried Mr. Gowry.\n",
            "   From the corner of his mouth Joshua whispered to Missy, “You know, I dislike you with something approaching the colossal proportions of first love. You have taught me mayhem. How?”\n",
            "   “When the teacher is ready, the pupil will arrive,” whispered Missy.\n",
            "   Laughter rose in tumbling, whirling waves. The room was giddy, airy, light. “So Pat says to Mike, do it yourself!” boomed Gowry.\n",
            "   “Oh, ho!” everyone exploded.\n",
            "   “Now, dear.” Missy waved at her ancient husband. “Tell one of your jokes. Oh, but first,” she remembered cleverly, “trot down-cellar, darling, and fetch the brandy.”\n",
            "   Gowry sprang forward with wild courtesy. “I know where it is!”\n",
            "   “Oh, Mr. Gowry, dont!”\n",
            "   Missy gestured frantically.\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry ran from the room.\n",
            "   “Oh, dear, dear me,” cried Missy.\n",
            "   A moment later, Gowry uttered a loud shriek from the basement, followed by a thunderous crash.\n",
            "   Missy hippety-hopped out, only to reappear moments later, her hand clutched to her throat. “Heavens to Betsy,” she wailed. “Come look. I do believe Mr. Gowry has pitched himself straight down the cellar stairs!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The next morning Joshua Enderby shuffled into the house lugging a large green velvet board some five feet by three, on which pistols were clasped in display.\n",
            "   “Here I am!” he shouted.\n",
            "   Missy appeared with a rum Collins in one bracelet-jangly hand, her cane thumping in the other. “Whats that?” she demanded.\n",
            "   “First, hows old Gowry?”\n",
            "   “Broken leg. Wished it had been his vocal cords.”\n",
            "   “Shame about that top cellar step gone loose, eh?” The old man hooked the green velvet board to the wall. “Good thing Gowry lurched for the brandy, not I.”\n",
            "   “Shame.” The wife drank thirstily. “Explain.”\n",
            "   “Im in the antique-gun-collecting business.” He waved at the weapons in their neat leather nests.\n",
            "   “I dont see—”\n",
            "   “With a collection of guns to clean-bang!” He beamed. “Man shoots wife while oiling matchlock garter pistol. Didnt know it was loaded, says weeping spouse.”\n",
            "   “Touche,” she said.\n",
            "   An hour later, while oiling a revolver, he almost blew his brains out.\n",
            "   His wife came thumping in and froze. “Hell. Youre still alive.”\n",
            "   “Loaded, by God!” He lifted the weapon in a trembling hand. “None were loaded! Unless—”\n",
            "   “Unless-?”\n",
            "   He seized three more weapons. “All loaded! You!”\n",
            "   “Me,” she said. “While you ate lunch. I suppose Ill have to give you tea now. Come along.”\n",
            "   He stared at the bullet hole in the wall. “Tea, hell,” he said. “Wheres the gin?!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was her turn for a shopping spree. “There are ants in the house.” She rattled her full shopping bag and set out ant-paste pots in all the rooms, sprinkled ant powders on windowsills, in his golf bag, and over his gun collection. From other sacks she drew rat poisons, mouse-killers, and bug-exterminators. “A bad summer for roaches.” She distributed these liberally among the foods.\n",
            "   “Thats a double-edged sword,” he observed. “Youll fall on it!”\n",
            "   “Bilge. The victim mustnt choose his demise.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but no violence. I wish a serene face for the coroner.”\n",
            "   “Vanity. Dear Josh, your face will twist like a corkscrew with one heaping teaspoon of Black Leaf Forty in your midnight cocoa!”\n",
            "   “I,” he shot back, “know a recipe that will break you out in a thousand lumps before expiring”\n",
            "   She quieted. “Why, Josh, I wouldnt dream of using Black Leaf Forty.”\n",
            "   He bowed. “I wouldnt dream of using the thousand-lump recipe.”\n",
            "   “Shake,” she said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Their assassins game continued. He bought huge rattraps to hide in the halls. “You run barefoot so: small wounds, large infections!”\n",
            "   She in turn stuck the sofas full of antimacassar pins. Wherever he laid a hand it drew blood. “Ow! Damn!” He sucked his fingers. “Are these Amazon Indian blowgun darts?”\n",
            "   “No. Just plain old rusty lockjaw needles.”\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said.\n",
            "   Though he was aging fast, Joshua Enderby dearly loved to drive. You could see him motoring with feeble wildness up and down the hills of Beverly, mouth gaped, eyes blinking palely.\n",
            "   One afternoon he phoned from Malibu. “Missy? My God, I almost dove from a cliff. My right front wheel flew off on a straightaway!”\n",
            "   “I planned it for a curve!”\n",
            "   “Sorry.”\n",
            "   “Got the idea from Action News. Loosen cars wheel lugs:\n",
            "   tomato surprise.”\n",
            "   “Never mind about careless old me,” he said. “Whats new with you?”\n",

            "   “Poor Lila.”\n",
            "   “I send her everywhere ahead now. She bucketed down like a laundry bag. Lucky shes all fat.”\n",
            "   “Well kill that one between us if were not careful.”\n",
            "   “Do you think? Oh, I do like Lila so.”\n",
            "   “Lay Lila off for a spell. Hire someone new. If we catch them in our crossfire, wont be so sad. Hate to think of Lila smashed under a chandelier or—”\n",
            "   “Chandelier!” Missy shrieked. “You been fiddling with my grandmas Fountainbleu Palace crystal hangings? Listen here, mister. Youre not to touch that chandelier!”\n",
            "   “Promise,” he muttered.\n",
            "   “Good grief! Those lovely crystals! If they fell and missed me, Id hop on one leg to cane you to death, then wake you up and cane you again!”\n",
            "   Slam went the phone.\n",

            "   Joshua Enderby stepped in from the balcony at supper that night. Hed been smoking. He looked at the table. “Wheres your strawberry crumpet?”\n",
            "   “I wasnt hungry. I gave it to the new maid.”\n",
            "   “Idiot!”\n",
            "   She glared. “Dont tell me you poisoned that crumpet, you old S. O. B.?”\n",
            "   There was a crash from the kitchen.\n",
            "   Joshua went to look and returned. “Shes not new any-more,” he said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   They stashed the new maid in an attic trunk. No one telephoned to ask for her.\n",
            "   “Disappointing,” observed Missy on the seventh day. “I felt certain thered be a tall, cold man with a notebook and another with a camera and flashbulbs flashing. Poor girl was lonelier than we guessed.”\n",
            "   Cocktail parties streamed wildly through the house. It was Missys idea. “So we can pick each other off in a forest of obstacles; moving targets!”\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry, gamely returning to the house, limping after his tumble of some weeks before, joked, laughed, and didnt quite blow his ear off with one of the dueling pistols. Everyone roared but the party broke up early. Gowry vowed never to return.\n",
            "   Then there was a Miss Kummer, who, staying overnight, borrowed Joshuas electric razor and was almost but not quite electrocuted. She left the house rubbing her right underarm. Joshua promptly grew a beard.\n",
            "   Soon after, a Mr. Schlagel vanished. So did a Mr. Smith. The last seen of these unfortunates was at a Saturday night soiree at the Enderbys” mansion.\n",
            "   “Hide-and-seek?” Friends slapped Joshuas back jovially.\n",
            "   “How do you do it? Kill “em with toadstools, plant “em like mushrooms?”\n",
            "   “Grand joke, yes!” chortled Joshua. “No, no, ha, not toadstools, but one got locked in our stand-up fridge. Overnight Eskimo Pie. The other tripped on a croquet hoop. Defenestrated through a greenhouse window.”\n",
            "   “Eskimo Pie, defenestrated!” hooted the party people. “Dear Joshua, you are a card!”\n",
            "   “I speak only the truth,” Joshua protested.\n",
            "   “What wont you think of next?”\n",
            "   “One wonders what did happen to old Schlagel and that rascal Smith.”\n",

            "   “Let me explain. The Eskimo Pie was my dessert. But the croquet hoop? No! Did you spot it in the wrong place, hoping Id pop by and lunge through the greenhouse panes?”\n",
            "   Missy turned to stone; he had touched a nerve.\n",
            "   “Well, now, its time for a wee talk,” he said. “Cancel the parties. One more victim and sirens will announce the arrival of the law.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” Missy agreed. “Our target practice seems to wind up in ricochet. About that croquet hoop. You always take midnight greenhouse walks. Why was that damn fool Schlagel stumbling about out there at two a. m.? Dumb ox. Is he still under the compost?”\n",
            "   “Until I stash him with he-who-is-frozen.”\n",
            "   “Dear, dear. No more parties.”\n",

            "   That night by the fireplace, he poured a few glasses of their best port. While he was out of the room, answering the telephone, she dropped a little white powder in her own glass.\n",
            "   “Hate this,” she murmured. “Terribly unoriginal. But there wont be an inquest. He looked long dead before he died, theyll say as they shut the lid.” And she added a touch more lethal stuff to her port just as he wandered in to sit and pluck up his glass. He . eyed it and fixed his wife a grin. “Ah, no, no, you dont!”\n",
            "   “Dont what?” she said, all innocence.\n",
            "   The fire crackled warmly, gently on the hearth. The mantel clock ticked.\n",

            "   “Surely you dont think I poisoned your drink while you were out?”\n",
            "   “Trite. Banal. But possible.”\n",

            "   He looked surprised but traded glasses.\n",
            "   “Heres not looking at you!” both said, and laughed.\n",
            "   They drank with mysterious smiles.\n",
            "   And then they sat with immense satisfaction in their easy chairs, the firelight glimmering on their ghost-pale faces, letting the port warm their almost spidery veins. He stuck his legs out and held one hand to the fire. “Ah.” He sighed.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing quite like port!”\n",
            "   She leaned her small gray head back, dozing, gumming her red-sticky mouth, and glancing at him with half-secretive, lazy eyes. “Poor Lila,” she murmured.\n",
            "   “Yes,” he murmured. “Lila. Poor.”\n",
            "   The fire popped and she at last added, “Poor Mr. Schlagel.”\n",
            "   “Yes.” He drowsed. “Poor Schlagel. Dont forget Smith.”\n",
            "   “And you, old man,” she said finally, slowly, slyly. “How do you feel?”\n",
            "   “Sleepy.”\n",
            "   “Very sleepy?”\n",
            "   “Un-huh.” He studied her with bright eyes. “And, my dear, what about you?”\n",
            "   “Sleepy,” she said behind closed eyes. Then they popped wide. “Why all these questions?”\n",
            "   “Indeed,” he said, stirring alert. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Oh, well, because...” She examined her little black shoe moving in a low rhythm a long way off below her knee. “I think, or perhaps imagine, I have just destroyed your digestive and nervous systems.”\n",
            "   For the moment he was drowsily content and examined the warm fire and listened to the clock tick. “What you mean is that you have just poisoned me?” He dreamed the words. “You what!?” He jumped as all the air gusted from his body. The port glass shattered on the floor.\n",
            "   She leaned forward like a fortune-teller eagerly predicting futures.\n",
            "   “I cleverly poisoned my own drink and knew that youd ask to trade off, so you felt safe. And we did!” Her laugh tinkled.\n",
            "   He fell back in his chair, clutching at his face to stop the wild swiveling of his eyes. Then suddenly he remembered something and let out an incredible explosion of laughter.\n",
            "   “Why,” cried Missy, “why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “Because,” he gasped, tears streaming down his cheeks, his mouth grinning horribly, “I poisoned my drink! and hoped for an excuse to change with you!”\n",
            "   “Oh, dear,” she cried, no longer smiling. “How stupid of us. Why didnt I guess?”\n",
            "   “Because both of us are much too clever by far!” And he lay back, chortling.\n",
            "   “Oh, the mortification, the embarrassment, I feel stark naked and hate myself!”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he husked. “Think instead how much you still hate me.”\n",
            "   “With all my withered heart and soul. You?”\n",
            "   “No deathbed forgiveness here, old lily-white iron-maiden wife 0 mine. Cheerio,” he added faintly, far away.\n",
            "   “If you think Ill say “Cheerio” back, youre crazed,” she whispered, her head rolling to one side, her eyes clamped,\n",
            "   her mouth gone loose around the words. “But what the hell. Cheer—”\n",
            "   At which her breath ceased and the fire burned to ashes as the clock ticked and ticked in the quiet room.\n",
            "   Friends found them strewn in their library chairs the next day, both looking more than usually pleased with their situation.\n",

            "   My wife and I were seated at a Saturday night performance, it was summer and warm, the audience melting in weather and conviviality. All around I saw married and engaged couples delighted and then alarmed by the comic opera of their lives which was being shown in immense symbol onstage.\n",
            "   A woman was sawed in half. How the husbands in the audience smiled.\n",
            "   A woman in a cabinet vanished. A bearded magician wept for her in despair. Then, at the tip-top of the balcony, she appeared, waving a white-powdered hand, infinitely beautiful, unattainable, far away.\n",
            "   How the wives grinned their cat grins!\n",
            "   “Look at them!” I said to my wife.\n",
            "   A woman floated in midair... a goddess born in all mens minds by their own true love. Let not her dainty feet touch earth. Keep her on that invisible pedestal. Watch it! God, dont tell me how its done, anyone! Ah, look at her float, and dream.\n",
            "   And what was that man who spun plates, globes, stars, torches, his elbows twirling hoops, his nose balancing a blue feather, sweating everything at once! What, I asked myself, but the commuter husband, lover, worker, the quick luncher, juggling hour, Benzedrine, Nembutal, bank balances, and budgets?\n",
            "   Obviously, none of us had come to escape the world outside, but rather to have it tossed back at us in more easily digested forms, brighter, cleaner, quicker, neater; a spectacle both heartening and melancholy.\n",
            "   Who in life has not seen a woman disappear?\n",
            "   There, on the black, plush stage, women, mysteries of talc and rose petal, vanished. Cream alabaster statues, sculptures of summer lily and fresh rain melted to dreams, and the dreams became empty mirrors even as the magician reached hungrily to seize them.\n",
            "   From cabinets and nests of boxes, from flung sea-nets, shattering like porcelain as the conjurer fired his gun, the women vanished.\n",
            "   Symbolic, I thought. Why do magicians point pistols at lovely assistants, unless through some secret pact with the male subconscious?\n",

            "   I looked to see if she was joking. In the dark, her dim mouth seemed to be smiling, but the quality of that smile was lost to me.\n",

            "   There, with no great fanfare, no swirl of cape, no bow, only the most condescending tilt of her head, and the faintest elevation of her left eyebrow, stood Miss Quick.\n",
            "   I thought it was a dog act, when she snapped her fingers.\n",

            "   It was obvious instantly that Miss Quick was the same woman who had been vanishing all evening.\n",
            "   Budget show, I thought; everyone doubles in brass. I dont like her.\n",
            "   “What?” asked my wife.\n",
            "   “Am I talking out loud again?”\n",
            "   But really, Miss Quick provoked me. For she looked as if she had gone backstage, shrugged on a rumpled tweed walking suit, one size too large, gravy-spotted and grass-stained, and then purposely rumpled her hair, painted her lipstick askew, and was on the point of exiting the stage door when someone cried, “Youre on!”\n",
            "   So here she was now, in her practical shoes, her nose shiny, her hands in motion but her face immobile, getting it over with .\n",

            "   The audience waited.\n",
            "   “Thats all! Acts over! Back to your seats!”\n",
            "   Snap! went her plain fingers.\n",
            "   The men, dismayed, sheepishly peering at each other, ambled off. She let them stumble half down the stairs into darkness, then yawned:\n",
            "   “Havent you forgotten something?”\n",
            "   Eagerly, they turned.\n",
            "   “Here.”\n",
            "   With a smile like the very driest wine, she lazily unwedged a wallet from one of her pockets. She removed another wallet from within her coat. Followed by a third, a fourth, a fifth! Ten wallets in all!\n",
            "   She held them forth, like biscuits, to good beasts. The men blinked. No, those were not their wallets! They had been onstage for only an instant. She had mingled with them only in passing. It was all a joke. Surely she was offering them brand-new wallets, compliments of the show!\n",
            "   But now the men began feeling themselves, like sculptures finding unseen flaws in old, hastily flung together armatures. Their mouths gaped, their hands grew more frantic, slapping their chest-pockets, digging their pockets.\n",
            "   All the while Miss Quick ignored them to calmly sort their wallets like the morning mail.\n",
            "   It was at this precise moment I noticed the man on the far right end of the line, half on the stage. I lifted my opera glasses. I looked once. I looked twice.\n",
            "   “Well,” I said lightly. “There seems to be a man there who somewhat resembles me.”\n",
            "   “Oh?” said my wife.\n",
            "   I handed her the glasses, casually. “Far right.”\n",
            "   “Its not like you,” said my wife. “Its you!”\n",
            "   “Well, almost,” I said modestly.\n",
            "   The fellow was nice-looking. It was hardly cricket to look thus upon yourself and pronounce favorable verdicts. Simultaneously, I had grown quite cold. I took back the opera glasses and nodded, fascinated. “Crew cut. Horn-rimmed glasses. Pink complexion. Blue eyes—”\n",
            "   “Your absolute twin!” cried my wife.\n",
            "   And this was true. And it was strange, sitting there, watching myself onstage.\n",
            "   “No, no, no,” I kept whispering.\n",
            "   But yet, what my mind refused, my eye accepted. Arent there two billion people in this world? Yes! All different snowflakes, no two the same! But now here, delivered into my gaze, endangering my ego and my complacency, here was a casting from the same absolutes, the identical mold.\n",
            "   Should I believe, disbelieve, feel proud, or run scared? For here I stood witness to the forgetfulness of God.\n",
            "   “I dont think,” said God, “Ive made one like this before.”\n",
            "   But, I thought, entranced, delighted, alarmed: God errs.\n",
            "   Flashes from old psychology books lit my mind.\n",
            "   Heredity. Environment.\n",
            "   “Smith! Jones! Helstrom!”\n",
            "   Onstage, in bland drill-sergeant tones, Miss Quick called roll and handed back the stolen goods.\n",
            "   You borrow your body from all your forebears, I thought. Heredity.\n",
            "   But isnt the body also an environment?\n",
            "   “Winters!”\n",
            "   Environment, they say, surrounds you. Well, doesnt the body surround, with its lakes, its architectures of bone, its overabundances, or wastelands of soul? Does not what is seen in passing window-mirrors, a face either serene snowfalls or a pitted abyss, the hands like swans or sparrows, the feet anvils or hummingbirds, the body a lumpy wheat-sack or a summer fern, do these not, seen, paint the mind, set the image, shape the brain and psyche like clay? They do!\n",
            "   “Bidwell! Rogers!”\n",
            "   Well, then, trapped in the same environmental flesh, how fared this stranger onstage?\n",
            "   In the old fashion, I wanted to leap to my feet and call, “What oclock is it?”\n",
            "   And he, like the town crier passing late with my face, might half mournfully reply, “Nine oclock, and alls well\n",
            "   But was all well with him?\n",
            "   Question: did those horn-rims cover a myopia not only of light but of spirit?\n",
            "   Question: was the slight obesity pressed to his skeleton symbolic of a similar gathering of tissue in his head?\n",
            "   In sum, did his soul go north while mine went south, the same flesh cloaking us but our minds reacting, one winter, one summer?\n",
            "   “My God,” I said, half aloud. “Suppose were absolutely identical!”\n",
            "   “Shh!” said a woman behind me.\n",
            "   I swallowed hard.\n",
            "   Suppose, I thought, he is a chain-smoker, light sleeper, overeater, manic-depressive, glib talker, deep/shallow thinker, flesh fancier...\n",
            "   No one with that body, that face, could be otherwise. Even our names must be similar.\n",
            "   Our names!\n",
            "   “...I... bl... er...” .\n",
            "   Miss Quick spoke his!\n",
            "   Someone coughed. I missed it.\n",
            "   Perhaps shed repeat it. But no, he, my twin, moved forward. Damn! He stumbled! The audience laughed.\n",
            "   I focused my binoculars swiftly.\n",
            "   My twin stood quietly, center stage now, his wallet returned to his fumbling hands.\n",
            "   “Stand straight,” I whispered. “Dont slouch.”\n",
            "   “Shh!” said my wife.\n",
            "   I squared my own shoulders, secretly.\n",
            "   I never knew I looked that fine, I thought, cramming the glasses to my eyes. Surely my nostrils arent that thinly made, the true aristocrat. Is my skin that fresh and handsome, my chin that firm?\n",
            "   I blushed, in silence.\n",
            "   After all, if my wife said that was me, accept it! The lamplight of pure intelligence shone softly from every pore of his face.\n",
            "   “The glasses.” My wife nudged me.\n",
            "   Reluctantly I gave them up.\n",
            "   She trained the glasses rigidly, not on the man, but now on Miss Quick, who was busy cajoling, flirting, and repicking the pockets of the nearest men. On occasion my wife broke into a series of little satisfied snorts and giggles.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Miss Quick was, indeed, the goddess Shiva.\n",
            "   If I saw two hands, I saw nine. Her hands, an aviary, flew, rustled, tapped, soared, petted, whirled, tickled as Miss Quick, her face blank, swarmed coldly over her victims; touched without touching.\n",
            "   “Whats in this pocket? And this? And here?”\n",
            "   She shook their vests, pinched their lapels, jingled their trousers: money rang. She punched them lightly with a vindictive forefinger, ringing totals on cash registers. She unplucked coat buttons with mannish yet fragile motions, gave wallets back, sneaked them away. She thrust them, took them, stole them again, while peeling money to count it behind the mens backs, then snatched their watches while\n",
            "   holding their hands.\n",
            "   She trapped a live doctor now!\n",

            "   “Temperature!” she cried. “One hundred ten!”\n",
            "   She closed her eyes and gave an insincere shake of her hips.\n",

            "   “Wheres your tie?”\n",
            "   They clapped their hands to their empty collars.\n",
            "   She plucked their ties from nowhere, tossed them back.\n",
            "   She was a magnet that invisibly drew good-luck charms, saints” medals, Roman coins, theater stubs, handkerchiefs, stickpins, while the audience ran riot, convulsed as these rabbit men stood peeled of all prides and protections.\n",
            "   Hold your hip pocket, she vacuumed your vest. Clutch your vest, she jackpotted your trousers. Blithely bored, firm but evanescent, she convinced you you missed nothing, until she extracted it, with faint loathing, from her own tweeds moments later.\n",
            "   “Whats this?!” She held up a letter. “Dear Helen: Last night with you—”\n",
            "   A furious blush as the victim tussled with Miss Quick, snatched the letter, stowed it away. But a moment later, the letter was restolen and reread aloud: “Dear Helen: Last night—”\n",
            "   So the battle raged. One woman. Ten men.\n",
            "   She kissed one, stole his belt.\n",

            "   Their men, shocked, joined in.\n",
            "   What a magnificent bully, Miss Quick! How she spanked her dear, idiot-grinning, carry-on-somehow men turned boys as she spun them like cigar-store Indians, knocked them with her brontosaur hip, leaned on them like barber-poles, calling each one cute or lovely or handsome.\n",
            "   This night, I thought, is lunatic! All about me, wives, hilarious with contempt, hysterical at being so shabbily revealed in their national pastimes, gagged for air. Their husbands sat stunned, as if a war were over that had not been declared, fought and lost before they could move. Each, nearby, had the terrible look of a man who fears his throat is cut, and that a sneeze would fill the aisle with heads .\n",
            "   Quickly! I thought. Do something!\n",
            "   “You, you onstage, my twin, dodge! Escape!”\n",
            "   And she was coming at him!\n",

            "   If I shouted this, or merely ground it to powder in my teeth, I dont recall, for all the men froze as Miss Quick seized my twin by the hand.\n",
            "   “Careful!” I whispered.\n",
            "   Too late. His watch was gone. He didnt know it. Your watch is gone! I thought. He doesnt know what time it is! I thought.\n",
            "   Miss Quick stroked his lapel. Back off! I warned myself.\n",
            "   Too late. His forty-dollar pen was gone. He didnt know it. She tweaked his nose. He smiled. Idiot! There went his wallet. Not your nose, fool, your coat!\n",
            "   “Padded?” She pinched his shoulder. He looked at his right arm. No! I cried silently, for now she had the letters out of his left coat pocket. She planted a red kiss on his brow and backed off with everything else he had on him, coins, identification, a package of chocolates which she ate, greedily. Use the sense God gave a cow! I shouted behind my face. Blind! See what shes doing!\n",
            "   She whirled him round, measured him, and said, “This yours?” and returned his tie.\n",
            "   My wife was hysterical. She still held the glasses fixed on every nuance and vibration of loss and deprivation on the poor idiots face. Her mouth was spoiled with triumph.\n",
            "   My God! I cried in the uproar. Get off the stage! I yelled within, wishing I could really yell it. At least get out while you have some pride!\n",
            "   The laughter had erupted a volcano in the theater, high and rumbling and dark. The dim grotto seemed lit with unhealthy fever, an incandescence. My twin wanted to break off, like one of Pavlovs dogs, too many bells on too many days: no reward, no food. His eyes were glazed with his insane predicament.\n",
            "   Fall! Jump in the pit! Crawl away! I thought.\n",
            "   The orchestra sawed at destiny with violins and Valkyrian trumpets in full flood.\n",

            "   She threw the shirt in the air. As it fell, so did his pants As his pants fell, unbelted, so did the theater. An avalanche of shock soared to bang the rafters and roll over us in echoes a thundering hilarity.\n",
            "   The curtain fell.\n",
            "   We sat, covered with unseen rubble. Drained of blood, buried in one upheaval after another, degraded and autopsied and, minus eulogy, tossed into a mass grave, we men took a minute to stare at that dropped curtain, behind which hid the pickpocket and her victims, behind which a man quickly hoisted his trousers up his spindly legs.\n",
            "   A burst of applause, a prolonged tide on a dark shore. Miss Quick did not appear to bow. She did not need to. She was standing behind the curtain. I could feel her there, no smile, no expression. Standing, coldly estimating the caliber of the applause, comparing it to the metered remembrances of other nights.\n",
            "   I jumped up in an absolute rage. I had, after all, failed myself. When I should have ducked, I bobbed; when I should have backed off, I ran in. What an ass!\n",
            "   “What a fine show!” said my wife as we milled through the departing audience.\n",
            "   “Fine!” I cried.\n",
            "   “Didnt you like it?”\n",
            "   “All except the pickpocket. Obvious act, overdone, no subtlety,” I said, lighting a cigarette.\n",
            "   “She was a whiz!”\n",
            "   “This way.” I steered my wife toward the stage door.\n",
            "   “Of course,” said my wife blandly, “that man, the one who looks like you, he was a plant. They call them shills, dont they? Paid by the management to pretend to be part of the audience?”\n",
            "   “No man would take money for a spectacle like that,” I said. “No, he was just some boob who didnt know how to be careful.”\n",
            "   “What are we doing back here?”\n",
            "   Blinking around, we found we were backstage.\n",
            "   Perhaps I wished to stride up to my twin, shouting, “Half-baked ox! Insulter of all men! Play a flute: you dance. Tickle your chin: you jump like a puppet! Jerk!”\n",
            "   The truth was, of course, I must see my twin close-up, confront the traitor and see where his true flesh differed from mine. After all, wouldnt I have done better in his place?!\n",
            "   The backstage was lit in blooms and isolated flushes, now bright, now dark, where the other magicians stood chatting. And there, there was Miss Quick!\n",
            "   And there, smiling, was my twin!\n",
            "   “You did fine, Charlie,” said Miss Quick.\n",
            "   My twins name was Charlie. Stupid name.\n",
            "   Charlie patted Miss Quicks cheek. “You did fine, maam!”\n",
            "   God, it was true! A shill, a confederate. Paid what? Five, ten dollars for letting his shirt be torn oft, letting his pants drop with his pride? What a turncoat, traitor!\n",
            "   I stood, glaring.\n",
            "   He glanced up.\n",
            "   Perhaps he saw me.\n",
            "   Perhaps some bit of my rage and impacted sorrow reached him.\n",
            "   He held my gaze for only a moment, his mouth wide, as if he had just seen an old school chum. But, not remembering my name, could not call out, so let the moment pass.\n",
            "   He saw my rage. His face paled. His smile died. He glanced quickly away. He did not look up again, but stood pretending to listen to Miss Quick, who was laughing and talking with the other magicians.\n",
            "   I stared at him and stared again. Sweat oiled his face. My hate melted. My temper cooled. I saw his profile clearly, his chin, eyes, nose, hairline; I memorized it all. Then I heard someone say:\n",
            "   “It was a fine show!”\n",
            "   My wife, moving forward, shook the hand of the pickpocketing beast.\n",
            "   On the street, I said, “Well, Im satisfied.”\n",
            "   “About what?” asked my wife.\n",
            "   “He doesnt look like me at all. Chins too sharp. Nose is smaller. Lower lip isnt full enough. Too much eyebrow. Onstage, far oft, had me going. But close up, no, no. It was the crew cut and horn-rims fooled us. Anyone could have horn-rims and a crew cut.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” my wife agreed, “anyone.”\n",
            "   As she climbed into our car, I could not help but admire her long, lovely legs.\n",
            "   Driving off, I thought I glimpsed that familiar face in the passing crowd. The face, however, was watching me. I wasnt sure. Resemblances, I now knew, are superficial.\n",
            "   The face vanished in the crowd.\n",
            "   “Ill never forget,” said my wife, “when his pants-fell!” I drove very fast, then drove very slow, all the way home.\n",

            "   Good evening. Welcome. I see you have my invitation in your hands. Decided to be brave, did you? Fine. Here we are Grab onto this.”\n",
            "   The tall, handsome stranger with the heavenly eyes and the impossibly blond hair handed me a wineglass.\n",
            "   “Clean your palate,” he said.\n",
            "   I took the glass and read the label on the bottle he held in his left hand. Bordeaux, it read. St. Emilion.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said my host. “Its not poison. May I sit? And might you drink?”\n",
            "   “I might,” I sipped, shut my eyes, and smiled. “Youre a connoisseur. This is the best Ive had in years. But why this wine and why the invitation? What am I doing here at Grays Anatomy Bar and Grill?”\n",
            "   My host sat and filled his own glass. “I am doing a favor to myself. This is a great night, perhaps for both of us. Greater than Christmas or Halloween.” His lizard tongue darted into his wine to vanish back into his contentment. “We celebrate my being honored, at last becoming—”\n",
            "   He exhaled it all out:\n",
            "   “Becoming,” he said, “a friend to Dorian! Dorians friend. Me!”\n",
            "   “Ah.” I laughed. “That explains the name of this place, then? Does Dorian own Grays Anatomy?”\n",
            "   “More! Inspires and rules over it. And deservedly so.”\n",
            "   “You make it sound as if being a friend to Dorian is the most important thing in the world.”\n",
            "   “No! In life! In all of life.” He rocked back and forth, drunk not from the wine but from some inner joy. “Guess.”\n",
            "   “At what?”\n",
            "   “How old I am!”\n",
            "   “You look to be twenty-nine at the most.”\n",
            "   “Twenty-nine. What a lovely sound. Not thirty, forty, or fifty, but—”\n",
            "   I said, “I hope youre not going to ask what sign I was born under. I usually leave when people ask that. I was born on the cusp, August, 1920.” I pretended to half rise. He pressed a gentle hand to my lapel.\n",
            "   “No, no, dear boy-you dont understand. Look here. And here.” He touched under his eyes and then around his neck. “Look for wrinkles.”\n",
            "   “But you have none,” I said.\n",
            "   “How observant. None. And that is why I have become this very night a fresh, new, stunningly handsome friend to Dorian.”\n",
            "   “I still dont see the connection.”\n",
            "   “Look at the backs of my hands.” He showed his wrists. “No liver spots. I am not turning to rust. I repeat the question, how old am I?”\n",
            "   I swirled the wine in my glass and studied his reflection in the swirl.\n",
            "   “Sixty?” I guessed. “Seventy?”\n",
            "   “Good God!” He fell back in his chair, astonished. “How did you know?”\n",
            "   “Word association. Youve been rattling on about Dorian. I know my Oscar Wilde, I know my Dorian Gray, which means you, sir, have a portrait of yourself stashed in an attic aging while you yourself, drinking old wine, stay young.”\n",
            "   “No, no.” The handsome stranger leaned forward. “Not stayed young. Became young. I was old, very old, and it took a year, but the clock went back and after a year of playing at it, I achieved what I set out for.”\n",
            "   “Twenty-nine was your target?”\n",
            "   “How clever you are!”\n",
            "   “And once you became twenty-nine you were fully elected as—”\n",
            "   “A Friend to Dorian! Bulls-eye! But there is no portrait, no attic, no staying young. Its becoming young agains the ticket.”\n",
            "   “Im still puzzled!”\n",
            "   “Child of my heart, you might possibly be another Friend. Come along. Before the greatest revelation, let me show you the far end of the room and some doors.”\n",
            "   He seized my hand. “Bring your wine. Youll need it!” He hustled me along through the tables in a swiftly filling room of mostly middle-aged and some fairly young men, and a few smoke-exhaling ladies. I jogged along, staring back at the EXIT as if my future life were there.\n",
            "   Before us stood a golden door.\n",
            "   “And behind the door?” I asked.\n",
            "   “What always lies behind any golden door?” my host responded. “Touch.”\n",
            "   I reached out to print the door with my thumb.\n",
            "   “What do you feel?” my host inquired.\n",
            "   “Youngness, youth, beauty.” I touched again. “All the springtimes that ever were or ever will be.”\n",
            "   “Jeez, the mans a poet. Push.”\n",
            "   We pushed and the golden door swung soundlessly wide.\n",
            "   “Is this where Dorian is?”\n",
            "   “No, no, only his students, his disciples, his almost Friends. Feast your eyes.”\n",
            "   I did as I was told and saw, at the longest bar in the world, a line of men, a lineage of young men, reflecting and re-reflecting each other as in a fabled mirror maze, that illusion seen where mirrors face each other and you find yourself repeated to infinity, large, small, very small, smallest, GONE! The young men were all staring down the long bar at us and then, as if unable to pull their gaze away, at themselves. You could almost hear their cries of appreciation. And with each cry, they grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful...\n",
            "   I gazed upon a tapestry of beauty, a golden phalanx freshly out of the Elysian fields and hills. The gates of mythology swung wide and Apollo and his demi-Apollos glided forth, each more beautiful than the last.\n",
            "   I must have gasped. I heard my host inhale as if he drank my wine.\n",
            "   “Yes, arent they,” he said.\n",
            "   “Come,” whispered my new friend. “Run the gauntlet. Dont linger; you may find tiger-tears on your sleeve and blood rising. Now.”\n",
            "   And he glided, he undulated, me along on his soundless tuxedo slippers, his fingers a pale touch on my elbow, his breath a flower scent too near. I heard myself say:\n",
            "   “Its been written that H. G. Wells attracted women with his breath, which smelled of honey. Then I learned that such breath comes with illness.”\n",
            "   “How clever. Do I smell of hospitals and medicines?”\n",
            "   “I didnt mean—”\n",
            "   “Quickly. Youre rare meat in the zoo. Hup, two, three!”\n",
            "   “Hold on,” I said, breathless not from walking fast but from perceiving quickly. “This man, and the next, and the one after that—”\n",
            "   “Yes?!”\n",
            "   “My God,” I said, “theyre almost all the same, look-alikes!”\n",
            "   “Bulls-eye, half true! And the next and the next after that, as far behind as we have gone, as far ahead as we might go. All twenty-nine years old, all golden tan, all six feet tall, white of teeth, bright of eye. Each different but beautiful, like me!”\n",
            "   I glanced at him and saw what I saw around me. Similar but different beauties. So much youngness I was stunned.\n",
            "   “Isnt it time you told me your name?”\n",
            "   “Dorian.”\n",
            "   “But you said you were his Friend.”\n",
            "   “I am. They are. But we all share his name. This chap here. And the next. Oh, once we had commoner names. Smith and Jones. Harry and Phil. Jimmy and Jake. But then we signed up to become Friends.”\n",
            "   “Is that why I was invited? To sign up?”\n",
            "   “I saw you in a bar across town a year ago, made queries. A year later, you look the proper age—”\n",
            "   “Proper-?”\n",
            "   “Well, arent you? Just leaving sixty-nine, arriving at seventy?”\n",
            "   “Well. “”\n",
            "   “My God! Are you happy being seventy?”\n",
            "   “Itll do. “”\n",
            "   “Do? Wouldnt you like to be really happy, steal some wild oats? Sow them?!”\n",
            "   “That times over.”\n",
            "   “Its not. I asked and you came, curious.\n",
            "   “Curious about what?”\n",
            "   “This.” He bared me his neck again and flexed his pale white wrists. “And all those!” He waved at the fine faces as we passed. “Dorians sons. Dont you want to be gloriously wild and young like them?”\n",
            "   “How can I decide?”\n",
            "   “Lord, youve thought of it all night for years. Soon you could be part of this!”\n",
            "   We had reached the far end of the line of men with bronzed faces, white teeth, and breath like H. G. Wells” scent of honey... \n",
            "   “Arent you tempted?” he pursued. “Will you refuse—”\n",
            "   “Immortality?”\n",
            "   “No! To live the next twenty years, die at ninety, and look twenty-nine in the damn tomb! In the mirror over there-what do you see?”\n",
            "   “An old goat among ten dozen fauns.”\n",
            "   “Yes!”\n",
            "   “Where do I sign up?” I laughed.\n",
            "   “Do you accept?”\n",
            "   “No, I need more facts.”\n",
            "   “Damn! Heres the second door. Get in!”\n",
            "   He swung wide a door, more golden than the first, shoved me, followed, and slammed the door. I stared at darkness.\n",
            "   “Whats this?” I whispered.\n",
            "   “Dorians Gym, of course. If you work out here all year, hour by hour, day by day, you get younger.”\n",
            "   “Thats some gym,” I observed, trying to adjust my eyes to the dim areas beyond where shadows tumbled, and voices rustled and whispered. “Ive heard of gyms that help keep, not make, you young... Now tell me...\n",
            "   “I read your mind. For every old man that became young in there at the bar, is there an attic portrait?”\n",
            "   “Well, is there?”\n",
            "   “No! Theres only Dorian.”\n",
            "   “A single person? Who grows old for all of you?”\n",
            "   “Touche”! Behold his gym!”\n",
            "   I gazed off into a vast high arena where a hundred shadows stirred and moaned like a tide on a terrible shore.\n",
            "   “I think its time to leave,” I said.\n",
            "   “Nonsense. Come. No one will see you. Theyre all... busy. I am Moses,” said the sweet breath at my elbow. “And I hereby tell the Red Sea to part!”\n",
            "   And we moved along a path between two tides, each shadowed, each more terrifying with its gasps, its cries, its slip-pages of flesh, its slapping like waves, its repeated whispers for more, more, ah, God, more!\n",
            "   I ran, but my host grabbed on. “Look right, left, now right again!”\n",
            "   There must have been a hundred, two hundred animals, beasts, no, men wrestling, leaping, falling, rolling in darkness. It was a sea of flesh, undulant, a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats, a glistening of skin, flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes, spun on leather horses, or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of lamentations and muffled cries. I stared across an ocean of rising and falling shapes. My ears were scorched by their bestial moans.\n",
            "   “What, my God,” I exclaimed, “does it all mean?”\n",
            "   “There. See.”\n",
            "   And above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window, forty feet wide and ten feet tall, and behind that cold glass Something watching, savoring, alert, one vast stare.\n",
            "   And over all there was the suction of a great breath, a vast inhalation which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible need. As the shadows tumbled and writhed, this inhalation tugged at them and the raw air in my nostrils. Somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked in darkness but did not exhale. There were long pauses as the shadows flailed and fell, and then another savoring inhalation. It swallowed breath. In, in, always in, devouring the sweaty air, hungering the passions.\n",
            "   And the shadows were pulled, I was pulled, toward that vast glass eye, that immense window behind which a shapeless Something stared to dine on gymnasium airs.\n",
            "   “Dorian?” I guessed.\n",
            "   “Come meet him.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but...” I watched the wild, convulsive shadows. “What are they doing?”\n",
            "   “Go find out. Afraid? Cowards never live. So!”\n",
            "   He swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive, I could not feel, for suddenly I lurched into a hothouse as the door slammed and was locked by my blond young friend. “Ready?”\n",
            "   “Lord, I must go home!”\n",
            "   “Not until you meet,” said my host, “him.”\n",
            "   He pointed. At first I could see nothing. The lights were dim and the place, like the gymnasium, was mostly shadow. I smelled jungle greens. The air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes. I smelled papaya and mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an unseen tide. But the tide was there with that immense inhaled breathing that rose and was quiet and began again.\n",
            "   “I see no one,” I said.\n",
            "   “Let your eyes adjust. Wait.”\n",
            "   I waited. I watched.\n",
            "   There were no chairs in the room, for there was no need of chairs.\n",
            "   He did not sit, he did not recline, he “prolonged” himself on the largest bed in history. The dimensions might easily have been fifteen feet by twenty. It reminded me of the apartment of a writer I once knew who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs.\n",
            "   So it was with this nest, with Dorian, immense, a gelatinous skin, a vitreous shape, undulant within that nest.\n",
            "   And if Dorian was male or female, I could not guess. This was a great pudding, an emperor jellyfish, a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from the exterior of which, on occasion, noxious gases escaped with rubbery sounds; great lips sibilating. That and the sough of that labored pump, that constant inhalation, were the only sounds within the chamber as I stood, anxious, alarmed, but at last impressed by this beached creature, cast up from a dark landfall. The thing was a gelatinous cripple, an octopus without limbs, an amphibian stranded, unable to undulate and seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay, featureless, with a mere x-ray ghost of legs, arms, wrists, and hands with skeletal fingers. At last I could discern, at the far end of this flesh peninsula, what seemed a half-flat face with a frail phantom of skull beneath, an open fissure for an eye, a ravenous nostril, and a red wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth.\n",
            "   And at last this thing, this Dorian, spoke.\n",
            "   Or whispered, or lisped.\n",
            "   And with each lisp, each sibilance, an odor of decay was expelled as if from a vast night-swamp balloon, sunk on its side, lost in fetid water as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks. It expelled but one lingering syllable:\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   Yes what?\n",
            "   And then it added:\n",
            "   Soooo...\n",
            "   “How long... how long,” I murmured, “has it... has he been here?”\n",
            "   “No one knows. When Victoria was Queen? When Booth emptied his makeup kit to load his pistol? When Napoleon yellow-stained the Moscow snows? Forevers not bad .\n",
            "   What else?”\n",
            "   I swallowed hard. “Is... is he?”\n",
            "   “Dorian? Dorian of the attic? He of the Portrait? And somewhere along the line found portraits not enough? Oil, canvas, no depth. The world needed something that could soak in, sponge the midnight rains, breakfast and lunch on loss, depravitys guilt. Something to truly take in, drink, digest; a pustule, imperial intestine. A rheum oesophagus for sin. A laboratory plate to take bacterial snows. Dorian.”\n",
            "   The long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and valves, and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the aqueous gels.\n",
            "   A slit widened to emit gas and again the single word:\n",
            "   Yessss .\n",
            "   “Hes welcoming you!” My host smiled.\n",
            "   “I know, I know,” I said impatiently. “But why? I dont even want to be here. Im ill. Why cant we go?”\n",
            "   “Because”-my host laughed-“you were selected.\n",
            "   “Selected?”\n",
            "   “Weve had our eye on you.”\n",
            "   “You mean youve watched, followed, spied on me? Christ, who gave you permission?”\n",
            "   “Temper, temper. Not everyone is picked.”\n",
            "   “Who said I wanted to be picked!?”\n",
            "   “If you could see yourself as we see you, youd know why.”\n",
            "   I turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it stare. Then all its apertures sealed: the saber-cut mouth, the slitted nostrils, the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless. The sibilance pumped with gaseous suctions.\n",
            "   Yessss, it whispered.\n",
            "   Lisssst, it murmured.\n",
            "   “And list it is!” My host pulled forth a small computer pad which he tapped to screen my name, address, and phone.\n",
            "   He glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me.\n",
            "   “Single,” he said.\n",
            "   “Married and divorced.”\n",
            "   “Now single! No women in your life?”\n",
            "   “Im walking wounded.”\n",
            "   He tapped his pad. “Visiting strange bars.”\n",
            "   “I hadnt noticed.”\n",
            "   “Creative blindness. Getting to bed late. Sleeping all day. Drinking heavily three nights a week.”\n",
            "   “Twice!”\n",
            "   “Going to the gym, look, every day. Workouts excessive. Prolonged steam baths, overlong massages. Sudden interest in sports. Endless basketball, soccer, tennis matches every night, and half the noons. Thats hyperventilation!”\n",
            "   “My business!”\n",
            "   “And ours! Youre balanced giddily on the rim. Shove all these facts in that one-armed bandit in your head, yank, and watch the lemons and ripe cherries spin. Yank!”\n",
            "   Jesus God. Yes! Bars. Drinks. Late nights. Gyms. Saunas. Masseurs. Basketball. Tennis. Soccer. Yank. Pull. Spin!\n",
            "   “Well?” My host searched my face, amused. “Three jackpot cherries in a row?”\n",
            "   I shuddered.\n",

            "   Gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless mound. Yessss.\n",
            "   They say that men in the grip of passion, blind to their own darkness, make love and run mad. Stunned by guilt, they find themselves beasts, having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church, town, parents, life. In explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure. Seeing her as unholy provocateur, they kill. Women, in similar rages and guilts, overdose. Eve lies self-slain in the Garden. Adam hangs himself with the Snake as noose.\n",
            "   But here was no passionate crime, no woman, no provocateur, only the great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host. And only words which riddled me with fusillades of arrows. Like an Oriental hedgehog, bristled with shafts, my body exploded with No, No, No. Echoed and then real:\n",
            "   “No!”\n",
            "   Yessss, whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue, the skeleton buried in ancient soups.\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   I gasped to see my games, steams, midnight bars, late-dawn beds: a maniac sum.\n",
            "   I rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked, creased, and oiled by passion, so cobwebbed and smashed by drink, that I tried to avert my gaze. The terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand. Stupidly, I reached to shake his and-rapped glass! A mirror. I stared deep into my own life. I had seen myself in shop windows, dim undersea men running in creeks. Mornings, shaving, I saw my mirrored health. But this! This troglodyte trapped in amber. Myself, snapshotted like ten dozen sexual acrobats! And who jammed this mirror at me? My beautiful host, and that corrupt flatulence beyond.\n",
            "   “You are selected,” they whispered.\n",
            "   “I refuse!” I shrieked.\n",
            "   And whether I shrieked aloud or merely thought, a great furnace gaped. The oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous streams. My beautiful host fell back, stunned that their search beneath my skin, behind my mask, had brought revulsion. Always when Dorian cried, “Friend,” raw gymnast teams had mobbed to catapult that armless, legless, featureless Sargasso Sea. Before they had smothered to drown in his miasma, to arise, embrace, and wrestle in the dark gymnasium, then run forth young to assault a world.\n",
            "   And I? What had I dared to do, that quaked that membranous sac into regurgitated whistling and broken winds?\n",
            "   “Idiot!” cried my host, all teeth and fists. “Out! Out!”\n",
            "   “Out,” I cried, spun to obey, and tripped.\n",
            "   I do not clearly know what happened as I fell. And if it was a swift reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that putrescent mound, I cannot say. I knew no lightning shock of murder, yet knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge. For what? I thought. What are you to Dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face, or causes the slightest twitch of leg, arm, hand, or fingernail, as the last fetid air from Dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils.\n",
            "   It was over in a second.\n",
            "   Something shoved me. Did my secret self, insulted, give that push? I was flung as if on wires, knocked to sprawl at Dorian.\n",
            "   He gave two terrible cries, one of warning, one of despair.\n",
            "   I was recovered so in landing, I did not sink my hands deep in that poisonous yeast, into that multiflorid Man of War jelly. I swear that I touched, raked, scarified him with only one thing: the smallest fingernail of my right hand.\n",
            "   My fingernail!\n",
            "   And so this Dorian was shot and foundered. And so the mammoth with screams collapsed. And so the nauseous balloon sank, fold on midnight fold, upon its own boneless sell, fissuring volcanic sulfurs, immense rectal airs, outgassed whistles, and whimpers of self-pitying despair.\n",
            "   “Christ! What have you done!? Murderer! Damn you!” cried my host, riven to stare at Dorians exhaustions unto death.\n",
            "   He whirled to strike, but ran to reach the door and cry, “Lock this! Lock! Whatever happens, for Gods sake, dont open! Now!” The door slammed. I ran to lock it and turn.\n",
            "   Quietly, Dorian was falling away.\n",
            "   He sank down and down, out of sight. Like a great membranous tent with its poles removed, he vanished into the floor, down flues and vents on all sides of his great platform nest. Vents obviously created for such a massive disease-sac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas. Even as I watched, the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents, and I stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable strata of discards and half-born fetuses had lain sucking at sins, spoiled bones, and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty. That perverse royalty, that lunatic monarch, gone, all gone. A last choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death.\n",
            "   My God, I thought, even now, that, all that, that terrible miasma, that stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on clean shores where bathers come at dawn... \n",
            "   Even now... \n",
            "   I stood, eyes shut, waiting.\n",
            "   For what? There had to be a next thing, yes? It came.\n",
            "   There was a trembling, shivering, and then a quaking of the wall, but especially the golden door behind me.\n",
            "   I spun to see as well as hear.\n",
            "   I saw the door shaken, and then bombarded from the other side. Fists pummeled, struck, hammered. Voices cried out and screamed and then shrieked.\n",
            "   I felt a great mass ram the door to shiver, to slam it on its hinges.\n",
            "   I stared, fearful that the door might explode and let in the flood tide of nightmare-ravening, terrified beasts, the kennel of dying things. For now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape, to beg for mercy, were so terrible that I clamped my fists to my ears.\n",
            "   Dorian was gone, but they remained. Shrieks. Screams. Screams. Shrieks. An avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell, yammering.\n",
            "   What must they look like now? I thought. All those bouquets. All those beauties.\n",
            "   The police will come, I thought, soon. But .\n",
            "   No matter what... \n",
            "   I would not unlock that door.\n",

            "   But to put it simply, the most respected member of the Bentley family up and died.\n",
            "   Dog was his name, and dog he was.\n",
            "   The Bentleys, arising late Saturday morning, found Dog stretched on the kitchen floor, his head toward Mecca, his paws neatly folded, his tail not a-thump but silent for the first time in twenty years.\n",
            "   Twenty years! My God, everyone thought, could it really have been that long? And now, without permission, Dog was cold and gone.\n",
            "   Susan, the younger daughter, woke everyone yelling:\n",
            "   “Somethings wrong with Dog. Quick!”\n",
            "   Without bothering to don his bathrobe, Roger Bentley, in his underwear, hurried out to look at that quiet beast on the\n",
            "   kitchen tiles. His wife, Ruth, followed, and then their son Skip, twelve. The rest of the family, married and flown, Rodney and Sal, would arrive later. Each in turn would say the same thing:\n",
            "   “No! Dog was forever.”\n",
            "   Dog said nothing, but lay there like World War II, freshly finished, and a devastation.\n",
            "   Tears poured down Susans cheeks, then down Ruth Bentleys, followed in good order by tears from Father and, at last, when it had sunk in, Skip.\n",
            "   Instinctively, they made a ring around Dog, kneeling to the floor to touch him, as if this might suddenly make him sit up, smile as he always did at his food, bark, and beat them to the door. But their touching did nothing but increase their tears.\n",
            "   But at last they rose, hugged each other, and went blindly in search of breakfast, in the midst of which Ruth Bentley said, stunned, “We cant just leave him there.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley picked Dog up, gently, and moved him out on the patio, in the shade, by the pool.\n",
            "   “What do we do next?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Roger Bentley. “This is the first death in the family in years and—” He stopped, snorted, and shook his head. “I mean—”\n",
            "   “You meant exactly what you said,” said Ruth Bentley. “If Dog wasnt family, he was nothing. God, I loved him.”\n",
            "   A fresh burst of tears ensued, during which Roger Bentley brought a blanket to put over Dog, but Susan stopped him.\n",
            "   “No, no. 1 want to see him. I wont be able to see him ever again. Hes so beautiful. Hes so—old.”\n",
            "   They all carried their breakfasts out on the patio to sit around Dog, somehow feeling they couldnt ignore him by eating inside.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley telephoned his other children, whose response, after the first tears, was the same: theyd be right over. Wait.\n",
            "   When the other children arrived, first Rodney, twenty-one, and then the older daughter, Sal, twenty-four, a fresh storm of grief shook everyone and then they sat silently for a moment, watching Dog for a miracle.\n",
            "   “What are your plans?” asked Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “I know this is silly,” said Roger Bentley after an embarrassed pause. “After all, hes only a dog—”\n",
            "   “Only!?” cried everyone instantly.\n",
            "   Roger had to back off. “Look, he deserves the Taj Mahal. What hell get is the Orion Pet Cemetery over in Burbank.”\n",
            "   “Pet Cemetery!?” cried everyone, but each in a different way.\n",
            "   “My God,” said Rodney, “thats silly!”\n",
            "   “Whats so silly about it?” Skips face reddened and his lip trembled. “Dog, why, Dog was a pearl of... rare price.\n",
            "   “Yeah!” added Susan.\n",
            "   “Well, pardon me.” Roger Bentley turned away to look at the pool, the bushes, the sky. “I suppose I could call those trash people who pick up dead bodies—”\n",
            "   “Trash people?” exclaimed Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Dead bodies?” said Susan. “Dog isnt a dead body!”\n",
            "   “What is he, then?” asked Skip bleakly.\n",
            "   They all stared at Dog lying quietly there by the pool. “Hes,” blurted Susan at last, “hes... hes my love!” Before the crying could start again, Roger Bentley picked up the patio telephone, dialed the Pet Cemetery, talked, and put the phone down.\n",
            "   “Two hundred dollars,” he informed everyone. “Not bad.”\n",
            "   “For Dog?” said Skip. “Not enough!”\n",
            "   “Are you really serious about this?” asked Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Yeah,” said Roger. “Ive made fun of those places all my life. But, now, seeing as how well never be able to visit Dog again—” He let a moment pass. “Theyll come take Dog at noon. Services tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Services!” Snorting, Rodney stalked to the rim of the pool and waved his arms. “You wont get me to that!”\n",
            "   Everyone stared. Rodney turned at last and let his shoulders slump. “Hell, Ill be there.”\n",
            "   “Dog would never forgive you if you didnt.” Susan snuffed and wiped her nose.\n",
            "   But Roger Bentley had heard none of this. Staring at Dog, then his family, and up to the sky, he shut his eyes and exhaled a great whisper:\n",
            "   “Oh, my God!” he said, eyes shut. “Do you realize that this is the first terrible thing thats happened to our family? Have we ever been sick, gone to the hospital? Been in an accident?”\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   “No,” said everyone.\n",
            "   “Gosh,” said Skip.\n",
            "   “Gosh, indeed! You sure as hell notice accidents, sickness, hospitals.”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” said Susan, and had to stop and wait because her voice broke. “Maybe Dog died just to make us notice how lucky we are.”\n",
            "   “Lucky?!” Roger Bentley opened his eyes and turned. “Yes! You know what we are—”\n",
            "   “The science fiction generation,” offered Rodney, lighting a cigarette casually.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You rave on about that, your school lectures, or during dinner. Can openers? Science fiction. Automobiles. Radio, TV, films. Everything! So science fiction!”\n",
            "   “Well, dammit, they are!” cried Roger Bentley and went to stare at Dog, as if the answers were there amongst the last departing fleas. “Hell, not so long ago there were no cars, can openers, TV. Someone had to dream them. Start of lecture. Someone had to build them. Mid-lecture. So science fiction dreams became finished science fact. Lecture finis!”\n",
            "   “I bet!” Rodney applauded politely.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley could only sink under the weight of his sons irony to stroke the dear dead beast.\n",
            "   “Sorry. Dog bit me. Cant help myself. Thousands of years, all we did is die. Now, that times over. In sum: science fiction.”\n",
            "   “Bull.” Rodney laughed. “Stop reading that junk, Dad.”\n",
            "   “Junk?” Roger touched Dogs muzzle. “Sure. But how about Lister, Pasteur, Salk? Hated death. Jumped to stop it. Thats all science fiction was ever about. Hating the way things are, wanting to make things different. Junk?!”\n",
            "   “Ancient history, Pop.”\n",
            "   “Ancient?” Roger Bentley fixed his son with a terrible eye. “Christ. When I was born in 1920, if you wanted to visit your family on Sundays you—”\n",
            "   “Went to the graveyard?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Yes. My brother and sister died when I was seven. Half of my family gone! Tell me, dear children, how many of your friends died while you were growing up. In grammar school? High school?”\n",
            "   He included the family in his gaze, and waited.\n",
            "   “None,” said Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “None! You hear that? None! Christ. Six of my best friends died by the time I was ten! Wait! I just remembered!”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley hurried to rummage in a hall closet and brought out an old 78-rpm record into the sunlight, blowing off the dust. He squinted at the label:\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?”\n",
            "   Everyone came to look at the ancient disc.\n",
            "   “Hey, how old is that?”\n",
            "   “Heard it a hundred times when I was a kid in the twenties,” said Roger.\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?” Sal glanced at her fathers face.\n",
            "   “This gets played at Dogs funeral,” he said.\n",
            "   “Youre not serious?” said Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   Just then the doorbell rang.\n",
            "   “That cant be the Pet Cemetery people come to take Dog-?”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Susan. “Not so soon!”\n",
            "   Instinctively, the family formed a wall between Dog and the doorbell sound, holding off eternity.\n",
            "   Then they cried, one more time.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The strange and wonderful thing about the funeral was how many people came.\n",
            "   “I didnt know Dog had so many friends,” Susan blubbered.\n",
            "   “He freeloaded all around town,” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Speak kindly of the dead.”\n",
            "   “Well, he did, dammit., Otherwise why is Bill Johnson here, or Gert Skall, or Jim across the street?”\n",
            "   “Dog,” said Roger Bentley, “I sure wish you could see this.”\n",
            "   “He does.” Susans eyes welled over. “Wherever he is.”\n",
            "   “Good old Sue,” whispered Rodney, “who cries at telephone books—”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” cried Susan.\n",
            "   “Hush, both of you.”\n",
            "   And Roger Bentley moved, eyes down, toward the front of the small funeral parlor where Dog was laid out, head on paws, in a box that was neither too rich nor too simple but just right.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley placed a steel needle down on the black record which turned on top of a flake-painted portable phonograph. The needle scratched and hissed. All the neighbors leaned forward.\n",
            "   “No funeral oration,” said Roger quickly. “Just this .. And a voice spoke on a day long ago and told a story about a man who returned from vacation to ask friends what had happened while he was gone.\n",
            "   It seemed that nothing whatsoever had happened. Oh, just one thing. Everyone wondered what had killed the dog.\n",
            "   The dog? asked the vacationer. My dog died? Yes, and maybe it was the burned horseflesh did it. Burned horseflesh!? cried the vacationer. Well, said his informant, when the barn burned, the horseflesh caught fire, so the dog ate the burned horseflesh, died.\n",
            "   The barn!? cried the vacationer. How did it catch fire? Well, sparks from the house blew over, torched the barn, burned the horseflesh, dog ate them, died.\n",
            "   Sparks from the house!? shouted the vacationer. How-?\n",
            "   It was the curtains in the house, caught fire.\n",
            "   Curtains? Burned!?\n",
            "   From the candles around the coffin.\n",
            "   Coffin!?\n",
            "   Your aunts funeral coffin, candles there caught the curtains, house burned, sparks from the house flew over, burned down the barn, dog ate the burned horseflesh-In sum: no news, or what killed the dog!\n",
            "   The record hissed and stopped.\n",
            "   In the silence, there was a little quiet laughter, even though the record had been about dogs and people dying.\n",
            "   “Now, do we get the lecture?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “No, a sermon.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley put his hands on the pulpit to stare for long moments at notes he hadnt made.\n",
            "   “I dont know if were here for Dog or ourselves. Both, I suppose. Were the nothing-ever-happened-to-us people. Today is a first. Not that I want a rush of doom or disease. God forbid. Death, come slowly, please.”\n",
            "   He turned the phonograph record round and round in his hands, trying to read the words under the grooves.\n",
            "   “No news. Except the aunts funeral candles catch the curtains, sparks fly, and the dog goes west. In our lives, just the opposite. No news for years. Good livers, healthy hearts, good times. So-whats it all about?”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley glanced at Rodney, who was checking his wristwatch.\n",
            "   “Someday we must die, also.” Roger Bentley hurried on. “Hard to believe. Were spoiled. But Susan was right. Dog died to tell us this, gently, and we must believe. And at the same time celebrate. What? The fact that were the start of an amazing, dumbfounding history of survival that will only get better as the centuries pass. You may argue that the next war will take us all. Maybe.\n",
            "   “I can only say I think you will grow to be old, very old people. Ninety years from now, most people will have cured hearts, stopped cancers, and jumped life cycles. A lot of sadness will have gone out of the world, thank God. Will this be easy to do? No. Will we do it? Yes. Not in all countries, right off. But, finally, in most.\n",
            "   “As I said yesterday, fifty years ago, if you wanted to\n",
            "   visit your aunts, uncles, grandparents, brothers, sisters, the graveyard was it. Death was all the talk. You had to talk it. Times up, Rodney?”\n",
            "   Rodney signaled his father he had one last minute.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley wound it down:\n",
            "   “Sure, kids still die. But not millions. Old folks? Wind up in Sun City instead of marble Orchard.”\n",
            "   The father surveyed his family, bright-eyed, in the pews.\n",
            "   “God, look at you! Then look back. A thousand centuries of absolute terror, absolute grief. How parents stayed sane to raise their kids when half of them died, damned if I know. Yet with broken hearts, they did. While millions died of flu or the Plague.\n",
            "   “So here we are in a new time that we cant see because we stand in the eye of the hurricane, where everythings calm.\n",
            "   “Ill shut up now, with a last word for Dog. Because we loved him, weve done this almost silly thing, this service, but now suddenly were not ashamed or sorry we bought him a plot or had me speak. We may never come visit him, who can say? But he has a place. Dog, old boy, bless you. Now, everyone, blow your nose.”\n",
            "   Everyone blew his nose.\n",
            "   “Dad,” said Rodney suddenly, “could-we hear the record again?”\n",
            "   Everyone looked at Rodney, surprised.\n",

            "   He put the needle on the record. It hissed.\n",
            "   About a minute in, when the sparks from the house flew over to burn the barn and torch the horseflesh and kill the dog, there was a sound at the back doorway to the small parlor.\n",
            "   Everyone turned.\n",
            "   A strange man stood in the door holding a small wicker basket from which came familiar, small yapping sounds.\n",

            "   The whole family, drawn out into the sunlight, gathered around the stranger with the wicker basket, waiting for Father to arrive to throw back the coverlet on the small carrier so they could all dip their hands in.\n",

It was a wrenching at hidden paneling, it was a hollow knocking, a rapping, a testing, a clawing! It was a scratching at hollow boards, a ripping at bedded nails; it was a muffled closet shouting and demanding, far away, and a call to be noticed, followed by a silence.\n",

            "   Now whoever it was who had pounded and rapped and made his fingers raw, drawn blood with his fever and quest to be free, had drawn into silence, listening himself to see if his terror and drumming had summoned any help.\n",
            "   The winter night lay through the house with a falling-snow silence, silence snowing into every room, drifting over tables and floors, and banking up the stairwell.\n",
            "   Then the pounding started again. And then:\n",
            "   A sound of soft crying.\n",
            "   “Downstairs.”\n",
            "   “Someone in the house.”\n",
            "   “Lotte, do you think? The front doors unlocked.”\n",
            "   “Shed have knocked. Cant be Lotte.”\n",
            "   “Shes the only one it could be. She phoned.”\n",
            "   They both glanced at the phone. If you lifted the receiver, you heard a winter stillness. The phones were dead. They had died days ago with the riots in the nearest towns and cities. Now, in the receiver, you heard only your own heart-beat. “Can you put me up?” Lone had cried from six hundred miles away. “Just overnight?”\n",
            "   But before they could answer her, the phone had filled itself with long miles of silence.\n",
            "   “Lotte is coming. She sounded hysterical. That might be her,” said Martha Webb.\n",
            "   “No,” said Robert. “I heard that crying other nights, too. Dear God.”\n",
            "   They lay in the cold room in this farmhouse back in the Massachusetts wilderness, back from the main roads, away from the towns, near a bleak river and a black forest. It was the frozen middle of December. The white smell of snow cut the air.\n",
            "   They arose. With an oil lamp lit, they sat on the edge of the bed as if dangling their legs over a precipice.\n",
            "   “Theres no one downstairs, there cant be.”\n",
            "   “Whoever it is sounds frightened.”\n",
            "   “Were all frightened, damn it. Thats why we came out here, to be away from cities, riots, all that damned foolishness. No more wiretaps, arrests, taxes, neurotics. Now when we find it at last, people call and upset us. And tonight this, Christ!” He glanced at his wife. “You afraid?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont believe in ghosts. This is 1999; Im sane. Or like to think I am. Wheres your gun?”\n",
            "   “We wont need it. Dont ask me why, but we wont.” They picked up their oil lamps. In another month the small power plant would be finished in the white barns behind the house and thered be power to spare, but now they haunted the farm, coming and going with dim lamps or candles.\n",
            "   They stood at the stairwell, both thirty-three, both immensely practical.\n",
            "   The crying, the sadness, and the plea came from below in the winter rooms.\n",
            "   “She sounds so damned sad,” said Robert. “God, Im sorry for her, but dont even know who it is. Come on.”\n",
            "   They went downstairs.\n",
            "   As if hearing their footsteps, the crying grew louder. There was a dull thudding against a hidden panel somewhere.\n",
            "   “The Witch Door!” said Martha Webb at last.\n",
            "   “Cant be.”\n",
            "   “Is.”\n",
            "   They stood in the long hall looking at that place under the stairs, where the panels trembled faintly. But now the cries faded, as if the crier was exhausted, or something had diverted her, or perhaps their voices had startled her and she was listening for them to speak again. Now the winter-night house was silent and the man and wife waited with the oil lamps quietly fuming in their hands.\n",
            "   Robert Webb stepped to the Witch Door and touched it, probing for the hidden button, the secret spring. “There cant be anyone in there,” he said. “My God, weve been here six months, and thats just a cubby. Isnt that what the Realtor said when he sold the place? No one could hide in there and us not know it. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen!”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",
            "   “Shes gone, its gone, whatever it was, hell, that door hasnt been opened in our lifetime. Everyones forgotten where the spring is that unlocks it. I dont think there is a door, only a loose panel, and rats” nests, thats all. The walls, scratching. Why not?” He turned to look at his wife, who was staring at the hidden place.\n",
            "   “Silly,” she said. “Good Lord, rats dont cry. That was a voice, asking to be saved. Lotte, I thought. But now I know it wasnt she, but someone else in as much trouble.”\n",
            "   Martha Webb reached out and trembled her fingertips along the beveled edge of ancient maple. “Cant we open it?”\n",
            "   “With a crowbar and hammer, tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Robert!”\n",
            "   “Dont “Oh, Robert” me. Im tired.”\n",
            "   “You cant leave her in there to—”\n",
            "   “Shes quiet now. Christ, Im exhausted. Ill come down at the crack of dawn and knock the damned thing apart, okay?”\n",
            "   “All right,” she said, and tears came to her eyes.\n",
            "   “Women,” said Robert Webb. “Oh, my God, you and Lotte, Lotte and you. If she is coming here, if she makes it, Ill have a houseful of lunatics!”\n",
            "   “Lottes fine!”\n",
            "   “Sure, but she should keep her mouth shut. It doesnt pay now to say youre Socialist, Democrat, Libertarian, Pro-Life Abortionist, Sinn Fein Fascist, Commie, any damn thing. The towns are bombed out. People are looking for scapegoats and Lotte has to shoot from the hip, get herself smeared and now, hell, on the run.”\n",
            "   “Theyll jail her if they catch her. Or kill her, yes, kill her. Were lucky to be here with our own food. Thank God we planned ahead, we saw it coming, the starvation, the massacres. We helped ourselves. Now we help Lone if she makes it through.”\n",
            "   Without answering, he turned to the stairs. “Im dead on my feet. Im tired of saving anyone. Even Lotte. But hell, if she comes through the front door, shes saved.”\n",
            "   They went up the stairs taking the lamps, advancing in an ever-moving aura of trembling white glow. The house was as silent as snow falling. “God,” he whispered. “Damn, I dont like women crying like that.”\n",
            "   It sounded like the whole world crying, he thought. The whole world dying and needing help and lonely, but what can you do? Live in a farm like this? Far off the main highway where people dont pass, away from all the stupidity and death? What can you do?\n",
            "   They left one of the lamps lit and drew the covers over their bodies and lay, listening to the wind hit the house and creak the beams and parquetry.\n",
            "   A moment later there was a cry from downstairs, a splintering crash, the sound of a door flung wide, a bursting out of air, footsteps rapping all the rooms, a sobbing, almost an exultation, then the front door banged open, the winter wind blowing wildly in, footsteps across the front porch and gone.\n",
            "   “There!” cried Martha. “Yes!”\n",
            "   With the lamp they were down the stairs swiftly. Wind smothered their faces as they turned now toward the Witch Door, opened wide, still on its hinges, then toward the front door where they cast their light out upon a snowing winter darkness and saw nothing but white and hills, no moon, and in the lamplight the soft drift and moth-flicker of snowflakes falling from the sky to the mattressed yard.\n",
            "   “Gone,” she whispered.\n",
            "   “Who?”\n",
            "   “Well never know, unless she comes back.”\n",
            "   “She wont. Look.”\n",
            "   They moved the lamplight toward the white earth and the tiny footprints going off, across the softness, toward the dark forest.\n",
            "   “It was a woman, then. But... why?”\n",
            "   “God knows. Why anything, now in this crazy world?” They stood looking at the footprints a long while until, shivering, they moved back through the hall to the open Witch Door. They poked the lamp into this hollow under the stairs.\n",
            "   “Lord, its just a cell, hardly a closet, and look...”\n",
            "   Inside stood a small rocking chair, a braided rug, a used candle in a copper holder, and an old, worn Bible. The place smelled of must and moss and dead flowers.\n",
            "   “Is this where they used to hide people?”\n",
            "   “Yes. A long time back they hid people called witches. Trials, witch trials. They hung or burned some.”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes,” they both murmured, staring into the incredibly small cell.\n",
            "   “And the witches hid here while the hunters searched the house and gave up and left?”\n",
            "   “Yes, oh, my God, yes,” he whispered.\n",
            "   “Rob\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   She bent forward. Her face was pale and she could not look away from the small, worn rocking chair and the faded Bible.\n",
            "   “Rob. How old? This house, how old?”\n",
            "   “Maybe three hundred years.\n",
            "   “That old?”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “Crazy. Stupid...\n",
            "   “Crazy?”\n",
            "   “Houses, old like this. All the years. And more years and more after that. God, feel! If you put your hand in, yes? Would you feel it change, silly, and what if I sat in that rocking chair and shut the door, what? That woman... how long was she in there? Howd she get there? From way, way back. Wouldnt it be strange?”\n",
            "   “Bull!”\n",
            "   “But if you wanted to run away badly enough, wished for it, prayed for it, and people ran after you, and someone hid you in a place like this, a witch behind a door, and heard the searchers run through the house, closer and closer, wouldnt you want to get away? Anywhere? To another place? Why not another time? And then, in a house like this, a house so old nobody knows, if you wanted and asked for it enough, couldnt you run to another year! Maybe”-she paused-“here...?”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he muttered. “Really stupid!”\n",
            "   But still, some quiet motion within the closeted space caused both, at almost the same instant, to hold their hands out on the air, curious, like people testing invisible waters. The air seemed to move one way and then another, now warm, now cold, with a pulsation of light and a sudden turning toward dark. All this they thought but could not say. There was weather here, now a quick touch of summer and then a winter cold, which could not be, of course, but there it was. Passing along their fingertips, but unseen by their eyes, a stream of shadows and sun ran as invisible as time itself, clear as crystal, but clouded by a shifting dark. Both felt if they thrust their hands deep, they might be drawn in to drown in a mighty storm of seasons within an incredibly small space. All this, too, they thought or almost felt but could not say.\n",
            "   They seized their frozen but sunburned hands back, to stare down and hold them against the panic in their breasts.\n",
            "   “Damn,” whispered Robert Webb. “Oh, damn!” He backed off and went to open the front door again and look at the snowing night where the footprints had almost vanished.\n",
            "   “No” he said. “No, no.”\n",
            "   Just then the yellow flash of headlights on the road braked in front of the house.\n",
            "   “Lotte!” cried Martha Webb. “It must be! Lotte!” The car lights went out. They ran to meet the running woman half up the front yard.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   The woman, wild-eyed, hair windblown, threw herself at them.\n",
            "   “Martha, Bob! God, I thought Id never find you! Lost! Im being followed, lets get inside. Oh, I didnt mean to get you up in the middle of the night, its good to see you! Jesus! Hide the car! Here are the keys!”\n",
            "   Robert Webb ran to drive the car behind the house. When he came back around he saw that the heavy snowfall was already covering the tracks.\n",
            "   Then the three of them were inside the house, talking, holding onto each other. Robert Webb kept glancing at the front door.\n",
            "   “I cant thank you,” cried Lotte, huddled in a chair. “Youre at risk! I wont stay long, a few hours until its safe. Then...\n",
            "   “Stay as long as you want.”\n",
            "   “No. Theyll follow! In the cities, the fires, the murders, everyone starving, I stole gas. Do you have more? Enough to get me to Phil Merdiths in Greenborough? I—”\n",
            "   “Lotte,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “Yes?” Lotte stopped, breathless.\n",
            "   “Did you see anyone on your way up here? A woman? Running on the road?”\n",
            "   “What? I drove so fast! A woman? Yes! I almost hit her. Then she was gone! Why?”\n",
            "   “Well...\n",
            "   “Shes not dangerous?”\n",
            "   “No, no.”\n",
            "   “It is all right, my being here?”\n",
            "   “Yes, fine, fine. Sit back. Well fix some coffee—”\n",
            "   “Wait! Ill check!” And before they could stop her, Lotte ran to the front door, opened it a crack, and peered out. They stood with her and saw distant headlights flourished over a low hill and gone into a valley. “Theyre coming,” whispered Lotte. “They might search here. God, where can I hide?”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert glanced at each other.\n",
            "   No, no, thought Robert Webb. God, no! Preposterous, unimaginable, fantastic, so damned coincidental the mind raves at it, crows, hoots, guffaws! No, none of this! Get oft” circumstance! Get away with your goings and comings on not neat, or too neat, schedules. Come back, Lotte, in ten years, five years, maybe a year, a month, a week, and ask to hide. Even tomorrow show up! But dont come with coincidence in each hand like idiot children and ask, only half an hour after one terror, one miracle, to test our disbelief! Im not, after all, Charles Dickens, to blink and let this pass.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said Lotte.\n",
            "   “I—” said Robert.\n",
            "   “No place to hide me?”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “Weve a place.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “Here.” He turned slowly away, stunned.\n",
            "   They walked down the hall to the half-open paneling.\n",
            "   “This?” Lotte said. “Secret? Did you-7”\n",
            "   “No” its been here since the house was built long ago.” Lotte touched and moved the door on its hinges. “Does it work? Will they know where to look and find it?”\n",
            "   “No. Its beautifully made. Shut, you cant tell its there.” Outside in the winter night, cars rushed, their beams flashing up the road, across the house windows.\n",
            "   Lotte peered into the Witch Door as one peers down a deep, lonely well.\n",
            "   A filtering of dust moved about her. The small rocking chair trembled.\n",
            "   Moving in silently, Lotte touched the half-burned candle.\n",
            "   “Why, its still warm!”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert said nothing. They held to the Witch Door, smelling the odor of warm tallow.\n",
            "   Lotte stood rigidly in the little space, bowing her head beneath the beamed ceiling.\n",
            "   A horn blew in the snowing night. Lotte took a deep breath and said, “Shut the door.”\n",
            "   They shut the Witch Door. There was no way to tell that a door was there.\n",
            "   They blew out the lamp and stood in the cold, dark house, waiting.\n",
            "   The cars rushed down the road, their noise loud, and their yellow headlights bright in the falling snow. The wind stirred the footprints in the yard, one pair going out, another coming in, and the tracks of Lottes car fast vanishing, and at last gone.\n",
            "   “Thank God,” whispered Martha.\n",
            "   The cars, honking, whipped around the last bend and down the hill and stopped, waiting, looking in at the dark house. Then, at last, they started up away into the snow and the hills.\n",
            "   Soon their lights were gone and their sound gone with them.\n",
            "   “We were lucky,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “But shes not.”\n",
            "   “She?”\n",
            "   “That woman, whoever she was, ran out of here. Theyll find here. Somebodyll find her.”\n",
            "   “Christ, thats right.”\n",
            "   “And she has no I. D., no proof of herself. And she doesnt know whats happened to her. And when she tells them who she is and where she came from!”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes.”\n",
            "   “God help her.”\n",
            "   They looked into the snowing night but saw nothing. Everything was still. “You cant escape,” she said. “No matter what you do, no one can escape.”\n",
            "   They moved away from the window and down the hall to the Witch Door and touched it.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they called.\n",
            "   The Witch Door did not tremble or move. “Lotte, you can come out now.” There was no answer; not a breath or a whisper. Robert tapped the door. “Hey in there.” “Lotte!”\n",
            "   He knocked at the paneling, his mouth agitated. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   “Open it!”\n",
            "   “Im trying, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Lotte, well get you out, wait! Everythings all right!”\n",
            "   He beat with both fists, cursing. Then he said, “Watch\n",
            "   out!” took a step back, raised his leg, kicked once, twice, three times; vicious kicks at the paneling that crunched holes and crumbled wood into kindling. He reached in and yanked the entire paneling free. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They leaned together into the small place under the stairs. The candle flickered on the small table. The Bible was\n",
            "   gone. The small rocking chair moved quietly back and forth, in little arcs, and then stood still.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They stared at the empty room. The candle flickered.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they said.\n",

            "   “Then shes safe at least, safe! Thank God!”\n",
            "   “Safe? Wheres she gone? You really think that? A woman in new clothes, red lipstick, high heels, short skirt, perfume, plucked brows, diamond rings, silk stockings, safe? Safe!” he said, staring deep into the open frame of the Witch Door.\n",
            "   “Yes, safe. Why not?”\n",
            "   He drew a deep breath.\n",
            "   “A woman of that description, lost in a town called Salem in the year 1680?”\n",

            "   The talk in the village in the year 1853 was, of course, about the madman above, in his sod-and-brick hut, with an untended garden and a wife who had fled, silent about his madness, never to return.\n",
            "   The people of the village had never drunk enough courage to go see what the special madness was or why the wife had vanished, tear-stained, leaving a vacuum into which atmospheres had rushed to thunder-clap.\n",
            "   And yet... \n",
            "   On a sweltering hot day with no cloud to offer shadow comfort and no threat of rain to cool man or beast, the Searcher arrived. Which is to say, Dr. Mortimer Goff, a man of many parts, most of them curious and self-serving, but also traveling the world for some baroque event, or miraculous revelation.\n",
            "   The good doctor came tramping up the hill, stumbling over cobbles that were more stone than paving, having abandoned his coach-and-horses, fearful of crippling them with such a climb.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff it turned out, had come from London, inhaling fogs, bombarded by storms, and now, stunned by too much light and heat, this good if curious physician stopped, exhausted, to lean against a fence, sight further up the hill, and ask:\n",
            "   “Is this the way to the lunatic?”\n",
            "   A farmer who was more scarecrow than human raised his eyebrows and snorted, “That would be Elijah Wetherby.”\n",
            "   “If lunatics have names, yes.”\n",
            "   “We call him crazed or mad, but lunatic will do. It sounds like book learning. Are you one of those?”\n",
            "   “I own books, yes, and chemical retorts and a skeleton that was once a man, and a permanent pass to the London Historical and Scientific Museum—”\n",
            "   “All well and good,” the farmer interrupted, “but of no use for failed crops and a dead wife. Follow your nose. And when you find the fool or whatever you name him, take him with you. Were tired of his shouts and commotions late nights in his iron foundry and anvil menagerie. Rumor says he will soon finish some monster that will run to kill us all.”\n",
            "   “Is that true?” asked Dr. Goff.\n",
            "   “No, it lies easy on my tongue. Good day, Doctor, and God deliver you from the lightning bolts that wait for you above.”\n",
            "   With this the farmer spaded the earth to bury the conversation.\n",
            "   So the curious doctor, threatened, climbed on, under a dark cloud which did not stop the sun.\n",

I am Dr. Goff, the so-called Searcher, for I move in behalf of our good Queen, turning rocks, digging truffles, curious for stuffs that might delight her Majesty or fill her museums, shops, and streets in the greatest city in the world. Have I reached the right place?”\n",
            "   “And just in time, for I am now in my eightieth year and of inconsequential vigor. If you had arrived next year, you might have found me in the churchyard. Do come in!”\n",
            "   At this moment, Dr. Goff heard a gathering of people behind him, all with a most unpleasant muttering, so at Mr. Wetherbys beckoning, he was glad to enter, sit, and watch an almost rare whiskey being poured without invitation. When he had quaffed the glass, Dr. Goff swiveled his gaze about the room.\n",
            "   “Well, where is it?”\n",
            "   “Where is what, sir?”\n",
            "   “The lunatic device, the insane machine that goes nowhere but in going might run down a child, a lamb, a priest, a nun, or an old blind dog, where?”\n",
            "   “So I am that famous, am I?” The old man let a few crumbs of laughter fall from his toothless mouth. “Well, sir. I keep it locked in the goats” shed behind: the outhouse of machines. Finish that to strengthen your sanity when you at last behold the delight and grievance of my long inventive life. So!”\n",
            "   The doctor drank, was replenished and soon out the door, across a small, smooth circle of turf, and to a shed whose door was triple-kept with numerous padlocks and keys. Old Wetherby entered, lit many candles, and beckoned the good doctor in.\n",
            "   He pointed as to a manger. The medical Searcher looked, expecting a mother, crib, and holy babe by the way Wetherby gestured and cried:\n",
            "   “There she be!”\n",
            "   “Is it female, then?”\n",
            "   “Come to think, she is!”\n",
            "   And there in the candlelight was Wetherbys mechanical pride.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff coughed, to hide his chagrin.\n",
            "   “That, sir, is but a metal frame!”\n",
            "   “But what a frame to hold velocities! Ha!”\n",
            "   And the old man, young with fevers, rushed to seize a largish wheel which he transported to fit to the front part of the frame. Then he fetched yet another circular object to fit into the frames rear.\n",
            "   “Well?” he cried.\n",
            "   “I see two wheels, half a cart, and no horse!”\n",
            "   “We will shoot all horses!” exclaimed Wetherby. “My invention, by the tens of thousands, will shy off all horses and banish manures. Do you know, each day in London a thousand tons of horse clods must be cleared, fertilizer wasted, not spread on neighbor fields but dumped as sludge down-Thames. God, how I talk!”\n",
            "   “But, sir, continue. Those look to be spinning wheels, borrowed from nearby farms?”\n",
            "   “They are, but spliced and strengthened with metal to sustain”—Wetherby touched himself—”one hundred twenty pounds. And heres the saddle for that weight.” Whereupon he fitted a saddle mid-frame. “And here the stirrups and ribbon to run the back wheel.” So saying, he affixed a longish leather ribbon to one stirrups rotary and tightened it on a spool at the rear.\n",
            "   “Do you begin to perceive, Doctor?”\n",
            "   “I am stranded in ignorance, sir.\n",
            "   “Well, then, be alert, for I now enthrone myself.”\n",
            "   And the old man, light as a chimpanzee, slung himself in place on a leather seat mid-frame between the silent spinning wheels.\n",
            "   “I still see no horse, sir.”\n",
            "   “I am the horse, Doctor. I am the horse a-gallop!”\n",
            "   And the old man thrust his feet in the stirrups to chum them up, around, and down; up, around, and down; as the rear wheels, provoked, did likewise, up, down, around, with a lovely hum, fastened in place on the platform planks.\n",
            "   “Aha.” The doctors face brightened. “This is a device to manufacture electrical power? Something from Benjamin Franklins storm-lightning notebooks?!”\n",
            "   “Gods, no. It could make lightnings, yes! But this, sir, not seeming one, is a horse, and I its night rider! So!”\n",
            "   And Wetherby pumped and wheezed, wheezed and pumped, and the rear wheels, locked in place, spun faster, faster, with a siren whine.\n",
            "   “All very well,” snorted the good doctor, “but the horse, if it is, and the rider, if you are, seem to be going nowhere! What will you call your machine?”\n",
            "   “I have had many nights and years to think.” Wetherby pumped and wheezed. “The Velocitor, perhaps.” Pumpwheeze. “Or the Precipitor, but no, that sounds as if I might be thrown from my “horse. “The Galvanizer, yes? Or why not—” Wheeze-pump. “The Landstride or Diminisher, for—” Wheeze-pump. “It does diminish time and distance. Doctor, you know Latin, eh? So, feet to wheel, wheel run by feet name it!”\n",
            "   “The Elijah, your given name, sir, the Elijah.”\n",
            "   “But he saw a wheel way in the middle of the air and it was a wheel in a wheel, is that not so?”\n",
            "   “When last I was in church, yes. And you are grounded, that is plain to see. Why not Velocipede, then? Having to do with speed and the applied toe and ankle?”\n",
            "   “Close-on, Dr. Goff, close-on. Why do you stare so fixedly?”\n",
            "   “It comes to mind that great times call forth great inventions. The inventor is child to his year and day. This is not a great time for such as you and yours. Did this century call you forth as its mightiest of all men of genius?”\n",
            "   Old Wetherby let his machine coast for a moment and smiled.\n",
            "   “No, I and my Tilda here, I call her Tilda, will instead be the gravity that calls forth the century. We will influence the year, the decade, and the millennium!”\n",
            "   “It is hard for me to believe,” said the medical gentleman, “that you will build a road from your sill to the city on which to glide your not-inconsiderable dream.”\n",
            "   “Nay, Doctor, the reverse is true. The city, and the world when they know me1 and this will run a concourse here to deliver me to fame.”\n",
            "   “Your head knocks heaven, Mr. Wetherby,” said the doctor dryly. “But your roots ache for sustenance, water, minerals, air. You stroke and pump wildly, but go nowhere. Once off that rack, will you not fall on your side, destroyed?”\n",
            "   “Nay, nay.” Wetherby, in gusts, pumped again. “For I have discovered some physics, as yet nameless. The faster you propel this bodily device, the less tendency to fall left or right but continue straight, if no obstacles prevent!”\n",
            "   “With only two wheels beneath? Prove it. Release your invention, set it free in flight, let us see you sustain your forward motion without breaking your bum!”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, shut up!” cried Wetherby as his kindling legs thrashed the pedals, racketing round as he leaned into a phantom wind, eyes clenched against an invisible storm, and churned the wheels to a frenzy. “Dont you hear? Listen. That whine, that cry, that whisper. The ghost in the machine, which promises things most new, unseen, unrealized, only a dream now but tomorrow—Great God, dont you see?! If I were on a real path this would be swifter than gazelles, a panic of deer! All pedestrians vanquished. All coach-and-horses in dust! Not twenty miles a day, but thirty, forty miles in a single glorious hour! Stand off, Time. Beware, meadow-beasts! Here glides, in full plummet, Wetherby with nothing to stop him!”\n",
            "   “Aye,” said the Searcher dryly, “you pump up a storm on that stand. But, set free, how would you balance on only two wheels!?”\n",
            "   “Like this!” cried Wetherby, and with a thrust of his hands and an uplift of frame, seized the Traveler, the Motion Machine, the Pathfinder, up free of its stand and in an instant plunged through the room and out the door, with Dr. Goff, in full pursuit, yelling:\n",
            "   “Stop! Youll kill yourself!”\n",
            "   “No, exhilarate my heart, oxygenate my blood!” cried Wetherby, and there he was in a chicken-yard he had trampled flat, paths some sixty feet around on which he now flailed his metal machine with scythings of ankle, toe, heel, and leg, sucking air, gusting out great laughs. “See? I do not fall! Two legs, two wheels, and: presto!”\n",
            "   “My God!” cried Dr. Goff, eyes thrust forth like hardboiled eggs. “Gods truth! How so?!”\n",
            "   “I fly forward faster than I fall downward, an unguessed law of physics. But lo! I almost fly. Fly! Good-bye horses, doomed and dead!”\n",
            "   And with “dead” he was overcome with such a delirium of pant and pump, perspiration raining off him in showers, that with a great cry, he wobbled and was flung, a meteor of flesh, over and down on a coop where the chickens, in dumb feather-duster alarms, exploded in shrieks as Wetherby slid in one direction while his vehicle, self-motivated, wheels a-spin, mounted Dr. Goff, who jumped aside, fearful of being spliced.\n",
            "   Wetherby, helped to his feet, protested his trajectory:\n",
            "   “Ignore that! Do you at last understand?”\n",
            "   “Fractures, wounds, broken skulls, yes!”\n",
            "   “No, a future brave with motion, “tween my legs. You have come a long way, Doctor. Will you adopt and further my machine?”\n",
            "   “Well,” said the doctor, already out of the yard, into the house, and to the front door, his face confused, his wits a patch of nettles. “Ah,” he said.\n",
            "   “Say you will, Doctor. Or my device dies, and I with it!”\n",
            "   “But...” said the doctor and opened the outer door, only to draw back, alarmed. “What have I done!” he cried.\n",
            "   Peering over his shoulder, Wetherby expressed further alarm. “Your presence is known, Doctor; the word has spread. A lunatic has come to visit a lunatic.”\n",
            "   And it was true. On the road and in the front garden yard were some twelve or twenty farmers and villagers, some with rocks, some with clubs, and with looks of malice or outright hostility caught in their eyes and mouths.\n",
            "   “There they are!” someone cried.\n",
            "   “Have you come to take him away?” someone else shouted.\n",
            "   “Yah” echoed the struggling crowd, moving forward.\n",
            "   Thinking quickly, Dr. Goff replied, “Yes. I will take him away!” And turned back to the old man.\n",
            "   “Take me where, Doctor?” whispered Wetherby, clutching his elbow.\n",
            "   “One moment!” cried the doctor to the crowd, which then subsided in murmurs. “Let me think.”\n",
            "   Standing back, cudgeling his bald spot, and then massaging his brow for rampant inspiration, Dr. Goff at last exhaled in triumph.\n",
            "   “I have it, by George. A genius of an idea, which will please both villagers, to be rid of you, and you, to be rid of them.”\n",
            "   “What, what, Doctor?”\n",
            "   “Why, sir, you are to come down to London under cover of night and I will let you through the side door of my museum with your blasphemous toy of Satan .\n",
            "   “To what purpose?”\n",
            "   “Purpose? Why, sir, I have found the path, the smooth surface, the road you spoke of at some future time!”\n",
            "   “The road, the path, the surface?”\n",
            "   “The museum floors, marble, smooth, lovely, wondrous, ohmigod, for all your needs!”\n",
            "   “Needs?”\n",
            "   “Dont be thick. Each night, as many nights as you wish, to your hearts content, you can ride that wheeled demon round and round, past the Rembrandts and Turners and Fra Angelicos, through the Grecian statues and Roman busts, careful of porcelains, minding the crystals, but pumping away like Lucifer all night till dawn!”\n",
            "   “Oh, dear God,” murmured Wetherby, “why didnt I think?”\n",
            "   “If you had you wouldve been too shy to ask!”\n",
            "   “The only place in the world with roads like future roads, paths like tomorrows paths, boulevards without cobbles, pure as Aphrodites cheeks! Smooth as Apollos rump!”\n",
            "   And here Wetherby unlocked his eyes to let fall tears, pent up for months and long hilltop years.\n",
            "   “Dont cry,” said Dr. Goff.\n",
            "   “I must, with joy, or burst. Do you mean it?”\n",
            "   “My good man, heres my hand!”\n",
            "   They shook and the shaking let free at least one drop of rain from the good doctors cheek, also.\n",
            "   “The excitement will kill me,” said Wetherby, wiping the backs of his fists across his eyes.\n",
            "   “No better way to die! Tomorrow night?”\n",
            "   “But what will people say as I lead my machine through the streets to your museum?”\n",
            "   “If anyone sees, say youre a gypsy whos stolen treasure from a distant year. Well, well, Elijah Wetherby, Im off.”\n",
            "   “Be careful downhill.”\n",
            "   “Careful.”\n",
            "   Half out the door, Dr. Goff tripped on a cobble and almost fell as a farmer said:\n",
            "   “Did you see the lunatic?”\n",
            "   “I did.”\n",
            "   “Will you take him to a madhouse?”\n",
            "   “Yes. Asylum.” Dr. Goff adjusted his cuffs. “Crazed. Worthless. You will see him no more!”\n",
            "   “Good!” said all as he passed.\n",
            "   “Grand,” said Goff and picked his way down the stone path, listening.\n",
            "   And uphill was there not a final, joyful, wheel-circling cry from that distant yard?\n",
            "   Dr. Goff snorted.\n",
            "   “Think on it,” he said, half aloud, “no more horses, no\n",
            "   more manure! Think!”\n",
            "   And, thinking, fell on the cobbles, lurching toward London and the future.\n",

            "   Her husband, Thomas, glanced over the rampart of The Wall Street Journa4 saw nothing to fasten his regard, and sank back in place. “What?”\n",
            "   “I said,” said Sheila, “the ninth years finished and you have a completely new wife. Or, to put it properly, the old wifes gone. So I dont think were married anymore.”\n",
            "   Thomas floored the Journal on his as-yet-untouched scrambled eggs, tilted his head this way and that, and said:\n",
            "   “Not married?”\n",
            "   “No, that was another time, another body, another me.” She buttered more toast and munched on it philosophically.\n",

            "   “Well, dear Thomas, dont you remember reading as children and later, that every nine years, I think it was nine, the body, churning like a gene-chromosome factory, did your entire person over, fingernails, spleen, ankles to elbows, belly, bum, and earlobes, molecule by molecule—”\n",
            "   “Oh, get to it,” he grumbled. “The point, wife, the point!”\n",
            "   “The point, dear Tom,” she replied, finishing her toast, “is that with this breakfast I have replenished my soul and psyche, completed the reworking of my entire flesh, blood, and bones. This person seated across from you is not the woman you married—”\n",

            "   “And if thats true, good Lord, then Im new, too. The old Tom, Thomas, Tommy, Tomasino is left behind back there with the shed snakeskin.”\n",
            "   Her eyes opened and she listened and he finished. “So were both brand-new. Youre the new, beautiful woman Ive been thinking about finding and loving in the last year. And Im that man you were heading out to search for. Isnt that right? Isnt that true?”\n",
            "   There was the merest hesitation and then she gave the smallest, almost imperceptible nod.\n",
            "   “Mercy,” he called gently.\n",
            "   “Thats not my name,” she said.\n",
            "   “It is now. New woman, new body, new name. So I picked one for you. Mercy?”\n",
            "   After a moment she said, “What does that make you?”\n",
            "   “Let me think.” He chewed his lip and smiled. “How about Frank? Frankly, my dear, I do give a damn.”\n",
            "   “Frank,” she murmured. “Frank and Mercy. Mercy and Frank.”\n",
            "   “It doesnt exactly ring, but itll do. Mercy?”\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   “Will you marry me?”\n",
            "   \t“What?”\n",
            "   “I said, will you marry me. Today. An hour from now. Noon?”\n",
            "   She turned at last to look down at him with a face all freshly tanned and washed.\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” she said.\n",
            "   “And well run away and be maniacs again, for a little while\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “No,” she said, “here is fine. Here is wonderful.”\n",
            "   “Come down, then,” he said, holding his hand up to her. “We have another nine years before another change. Come down and finish your wedding breakfast. Mercy?”\n",
            "   She came down the steps and took his hand and smiled.\n",
            "   “Wheres the champagne?” she said.\n",

            "BUG\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Looking back now, I cant remember a time when Bug wasnt dancing. Bug is short for jitterbug and, of course, those were the days in the late thirties, our final days in high school and our first days out in the vast world looking for work that didnt exist when jitterbugging was all the rage. And I can remember Bug (his real name was Bert Bagley, which shortens to Bug nicely), during a jazz-band blast at our final aud-call for our high school senior class, suddenly leaping up to dance with an invisible partner in the middle of the front aisle of the auditorium. That brought the house down. You never heard such a roar or such applause. The bandleader, stricken with Bugs oblivious joy, gave an encore and Bug did the same and we all exploded. After that the band played “Thanks for the Memory” and we all sang it, with tears pouring down our cheeks. Nobody in all the years after could forget: Bug dancing in the aisle, eyes shut, hands out to grasp his invisible girlfriend, his legs not connected to his body, just his heart, all over the place. When it was over, nobody, not even the band, wanted to leave. We just stood there in the world Bug had made, hating to go out into that other world that was waiting for us.\n",
            "   It was about a year later when Bug saw me on the street and stopped his roadster and said come on along to my place for a hot dog and a Coke, and I jumped in and we drove over with the top down and the wind really hitting us and Bug talking and talking at the top of his lungs, about life and the times and what he wanted to show me in his front parlor-front parlor, hell, dining room, kitchen, and bedroom.\n",
            "   What was it he wanted me to see?\n",
            "   Trophies. Big ones, little ones, solid gold and silver and brass trophies with his name on them. Dance trophies. I mean they were everywhere, on the floor by his bed, on the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, but in the parlor, especially, they had settled like a locust plague. There were so many of them on the mantel, and in bookcases instead of books, and on the floor, you had to wade through, kicking some over as you went. They totaled, he said, tilting his head back and counting inside his eyelids, to about three hundred and twenty prizes, which means grabbing onto a trophy almost every night in the past year.\n",
            "   “All this,” I gasped, “just since we left high school?”\n",
            "   “Aint I the cats pajamas?” Bug cried.\n",
            "   “Youre the whole darned department store! Who was your partner, all those nights?”\n",
            "   “Not partner, partners,” Bug corrected. “Three hundred, give or take a dozen, different women on three hundred different nights.”\n",
            "   “Where do you find three hundred women, all talented, all good enough, to win prizes?”\n",
            "   “They werent talented or all good,” said Bug, glancing around at his collection. “They were just ordinary, good, every-night dancers. I won the prizes. I made them good. And when we got Out there dancing, we cleared the floor.\n",
            "   Everyone else stopped, to watch us there out in the middle of nowhere, and we never stopped.”\n",
            "   He paused, blushed, and shook his head. “Sorry about that. Didnt mean to brag.”\n",
            "   But he wasnt bragging. I could see. He was just telling the truth.\n",
            "   “You want to know how this all started?” said Bug, handing over a hot dog and a Coke.\n",
            "   “Dont tell me,” I said. “I know.”\n",
            "   “How could you?” said Bug, looking me over.\n",
            "   “The last aud-call at L. A. High, I think they played “Thanks for the Memory,” but just before that—”\n",
            "   ““Roll Out the Barrel—”\n",
            "   “-the Barrel,” yes, and there you were in front of God and everyone, jumping.”\n",
            "   “I never stopped,” said Bug, eyes shut, back in those\n",
            "   years. “Never,” he said, “stopped.”\n",
            "   “You got your life all made,” I said.\n",
            "   “Unless,” said Bug, “something happens.”\n",
            "   What happened was, of course, the war.\n",
            "   Looking back, I remember that in that last year in school, sap that I was, I made up a list of my one hundred and sixty-five best friends. Can you imagine that? One hundred and sixty-five, count “em, best friends! Its a good thing I never showed that list to anyone. I would have been hooted out of school.\n",
            "   \tAnyway, the war came and went and took with it a couple dozen of those listed friends and the rest just disappeared into holes in the ground or went east or wound up in Malibu or Fort Lauderdale. Bug was on that list, but I didnt figure out I didnt really know him until half a lifetime later. By that time I was down to half a dozen pals or women I might turn to if I needed, and it was then, walking down Hollywood Boulevard one Saturday afternoon, I heard someone call:\n",
            "   “How about a hot dog and a Coke?”\n",
            "   Bug, I thought without turning. And thats who it was, standing on the Walk of Stars with his feet planted on Mary Pickford and Ricardo Cortez just behind and Jimmy Stewart just ahead. Bug had taken off some hair and put on some weight, but it was Bug and I was overjoyed, perhaps too much, and showed it, for he seemed embarrassed at my enthusiasm. I saw then that his suit was not half new enough and his shirt frayed, but his tie was neatly tied and he shook my hand off and we popped into a place where we stood and had that hot dog and that Coke.\n",
            "   “Still going to be the worlds greatest writer?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Working at it,” I said.\n",
            "   “Youll get there,” said Bug and smiled, meaning it. “You were always good.”\n",
            "   “So were you,” I said.\n",
            "   That seemed to pain him slightly, for he stopped chewing for a moment and took a swig of Coke. “Yes, sir,” he said. “I surely was.”\n",
            "   “God,” I said, “I can still remember the day I saw all those trophies for the first time. What a family! Whatever-?”\n",
            "   Before I could finish asking, he gave the answer.\n",
            "   “Put “em in storage, some. Some wound up with my first wife. Goodwill got the rest.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” I said, and truly was.\n",
            "   Bug looked at me steadily. “How come youre sorry?”\n",
            "   “Hell, I dunno,” I said. “Its just, they seemed such a part of you. I havent thought of you often the last few years or so, to be honest, but when I do, there you are knee-deep in all those cups and mugs in your front room, out in the kitchen, hell, in your garage!”\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Bug. “What a memory you got.”\n",
            "   We finished our Cokes and it was almost time to go. I couldnt help myself, even seeing that Bug had fleshed himself out over the years.\n",
            "   “When—” I started to say, and stopped.\n",
            "   “When what?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “When,” I said with difficulty, “when was the last time you danced?”\n",
            "   “Years,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “But how long ago?”\n",
            "   “Ten years. Fifteen. Maybe twenty. Yeah, twenty. I dont dance anymore.”\n",
            "   “I dont believe that. Bug not dance? Nuts.”\n",
            "   “Truth. Gave my fancy night-out shoes to the Goodwill, too. Cant dance in your socks.”\n",
            "   “Can, and barefoot, too!”\n",
            "   Bug had to laugh at that. “Youre really something. Well, its been nice.” He started edging toward the door. “Take care, genius—”\n",
            "   “Not so fast.” I walked him out into the light and he was looking both ways as if there were heavy traffic. “You know one thing I never saw and wanted to see? You bragged about it, said you took three hundred ordinary girls out on the dance floor and turned them into Ginger Rogers inside three minutes. But I only saw you once at that aud-call in “38, so I dont believe you.”\n",
            "   “What?” said Bug. “You saw the trophies!”\n",
            "   “You could have had those made up,” I pursued, looking at his wrinkled suit and frayed shirt cuffs. “Anyone can go in a trophy shop and buy a cup and have his name put on it!”\n",
            "   “You think I did that?” cried Bug.\n",
            "   “I think that, yes!”\n",
            "   Bug glanced out in the street and back at me and back in the street and back to me, trying to decide which way to run or push or shout.\n",
            "   “Whats got into you?” said Bug. “Whyre you talking like that?”\n",
            "   “God, I dont know,” I admitted. “Its just, we might not meet again and Ill never have the chance, or you to prove it. Id like, after all this time, to see what you talked about. Id love to see you dance again, Bug.”\n",
            "   “Naw,” said Bug. “Ive forgotten how.”\n",
            "   “Dont hand me that. You may have forgotten, but the rest of you knows how. Bet you could go down to the Ambassador Hotel this afternoon, they still have tea dances there, and clear the floor, just like you said. After youre out there nobody else dances, they all stop and look at you and her just like thirty years ago.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Bug, backing away but coming back. “No, no.”\n",
            "   “Pick a stranger, any girl, any woman, out of the crowd, lead her out, hold her in your arms and just skim her around as if you were on ice and dream her to Paradise.”\n",
            "   “If you write like that, youll never sell,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Bet you, Bug.”\n",
            "   “I dont bet.”\n",
            "   “All right, then. Bet you you cant. Bet you, By God, that youve lost your stuff!”\n",
            "   “Now, hold on,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “I mean it. Lost your stuff forever, for good. Bet you. Wanna bet?”\n",
            "   Bugs eyes took on a peculiar shine and his face was flushed. “How much?”\n",
            "   “Fifty bucks!”\n",
            "   “I dont have—”\n",
            "   “Thirty bucks, then. Twenty! You can afford to lose that, cant you?”\n",
            "   “Who says Id lose, dammit?”\n",
            "   “I say. Twenty. Is it a deal?”\n",
            "   “Youre throwing your money away.”\n",
            "   “No, Im a sure winner, because you cant dance worth shoats and shinola!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your money?” cried Bug, incensed now.\n",
            "   “Here!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your car!?”\n",
            "   “I dont own a car. Never learned to drive. Wheres yours?”\n",
            "   “Sold it! Jesus, no cars. How do we get to the tea dance!?” We got. We grabbed a cab and I paid and, before Bug could relent, dragged him through the hotel lobby and into the ballroom. It was a nice summer afternoon, so nice that the room was filled with mostly middle-aged men and their wives, a few younger ones with their girlfriends, and some kids out of college who looked out of place, embarrassed by the mostly old-folks music out of another time. We got the last table and when Bug opened his mouth for one last protest, I put a straw in it and helped him nurse a marguerita.\n",
            "   “Why are you doing this?” he protested again.\n",
            "   “Because you were just one of one hundred sixty-five close friends!” I said.\n",
            "   “We were never friends,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Well, today, anyway. Theres “Moonlight Serenade. “Always liked that, never danced myself, clumsy fool. On your feet, Bug!”\n",
            "   He was on his feet, swaying.\n",
            "   “Who do you pick?” I said. “You cut in on a couple? Or theres a few wallflowers over there, a tableful of women. I dare you to pick the least likely and give her lessons, yes?”\n",
            "   That did it. Casting me a glance of the purest scorn, he charged off half into the pretty teatime dresses and immaculate men, searching around until his eyes lit on a table where a woman of indeterminate age sat, hands folded, face thin and sickly pale, half hidden under a wide-brimmed hat, looking as if she were waiting for someone who never came.\n",
            "   That one, I thought.\n",
            "   Bug glanced from her to me. I nodded. And in a moment he was bowing at her table and a conversation ensued. It seemed she didnt dance, didnt know how to dance, didnt want to dance. Ah, yes, he seemed to be saying. Ah, no, she seemed to reply. Bug turned, holding her hand, and gave me a long stare and a wink. Then, without looking at her, he raised her by her hand and arm and out, with a seamless glide, onto the floor.\n",
            "   What can I say, how can I tell? Bug, long ago, had never bragged, but only told the truth. Once he got hold of a girl, she was weightless. By the time he had whisked and whirled and glided her once around the floor, she almost took off, it seemed he had to hold her down, she was pure gossamer, the closest thing to a hummingbird held in the hand so you cannot feel its weight but only sense its heartbeat sounding to your touch, and there she went out and around and back, with Bug guiding and moving, enticing and retreating, and not fifty anymore, no, but eighteen, his body remembering what his mind thought it had long forgotten, for his body was free of the earth now, too. He carried himself, as he carried her, with that careless insouciance of a lover who knows what will happen in the next hour and the night soon following.\n",
            "   And it happened, just like he said. Within a minute, a minute and a half at most, the dance floor cleared. As Bug and his stranger lady whirled by with a glance, every couple on the floor stood still. The bandleader almost forgot to keep time with his baton, and the members of the orchestra, in a similar trance, leaned forward over their instruments to see Bug and his new love whirl and turn without touching the floor.\n",
            "   When the “Serenade” ended, there was a moment of stillness and then an explosion of applause. Bug pretended it was all for the lady, and helped her curtsy and took her to her table, where she sat, eyes shut, not believing what had happened. By that time Bug was on the floor again, with one of the wives he borrowed from the nearest table. This time, no one even went out on the floor. Bug and the borrowed wife filled it around and around, and this time even Bugs eyes were shut.\n",
            "   I got up and put twenty dollars on the table where he might find it. After all, he had won the bet, hadnt he?\n",
            "   Why had I done it? Well, I couldnt very well have left him out in the middle of the high school auditorium aisle dancing alone, could I?\n",
            "   On my way out I looked back. Bug saw me and waved, his eyes as brimmed full as mine. Someone passing whispered, “Hey, come on, lookit this guy!”\n",
            "   God, I thought, hell be dancing all night.\n",
            "   Me, I could only walk.\n",
            "   And I went out and walked until I was fifty again and the sun was going down and the low June fog was coming in early over old Los Angeles.\n",
            "   That night, just before going to sleep, I wished that in the morning when Bug woke up he would find the floor around his bed covered with trophies.\n",
            "   Or at the very least he would turn and find a quiet and understanding trophy with her head on his pillow, near enough to touch.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "ONCE MORE, LEGATO\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine autumn and listened. The drink in his hand remained unsipped, his friend Black unspoken to, the fine house unnoticed, the very weather itself neglected, for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above them.\n",
            "   “My God,” he mid. “Do you “hear?”\n",
            "   “What, the birds?” asked his friend Black, doing just the opposite, sipping his drink, noticing the weather, admiring the rich house, and neglecting the birds entirely until this moment.\n",
            "   “Great God in heaven, listen to them!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   Black listened. “Rather nice.”\n",
            "   “clean out your ears!”\n",
            "   Black made a halfhearted gesture, symbolizing the cleaning out of ears. “Well?”\n",
            "   “Damn it, dont be funny. I mean really listen! Theyre singing a tune!”\n",
            "   “Birds usually do.”\n",
            "   “No, they dont; birds paste together bits and pieces maybe, five or six notes, eight at the most. Mockingbirds have repertoires that change, but not entire melodies. These birds are different. Now shut up and give over!”\n",
            "   Both men sat, enchanted. Blacks expression melted.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” he said at last. “They do go on.” He leaned forward and listened intently.\n",
            "   “Yes...” murmured Fentriss, eyes shut, nodding to the rhythms that sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads. “... ohmigod... indeed.”\n",
            "   Black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up. Fentriss protested with a fierce whisper:\n",
            "   “Dont spoil it. Sit. Be very still. Wheres my pencil? Ah...”\n",
            "   Half peering around, he found a pencil and notepad, shut his eyes, and began to scribble blindly.\n",
            "   The birds sang.\n",
            "   “Youre not actually writing down their song?” said Black.\n",
            "   “What does it look like? Quiet.”\n",
            "   And with eyes now open, now shut, Fentriss drew scales and jammed in the notes.\n",
            "   “I didnt know you read music,” said Black, astonished.\n",
            "   “I played the violin until my father broke it. Please! There. There. Yes!\n",
            "   “Slower,” he whispered. “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   As if hearing, the birds adjusted their lilt, moving toward piano instead of bravado.\n",
            "   A breeze stirred the leaves, like an invisible conductor, and the singing died.\n",
            "   Fentriss, perspiration beading his forehead, stopped scribbling and fell back.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned.” Black gulped his drink. “What was that all about?”\n",
            "   “Writing a song.” Fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper. “Or a tone poem.”\n",
            "   “Let me see that!”\n",
            "   “Wait.” The tree shook itself gently, but produced no further notes. “I want to be sure theyre done.”\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Black seized the pages and let his eyes drift over the scales. “Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,” he said, aghast. “It works.” He glanced up at the thick green of the tree, where no throat warbled, no wing stirred. “What kind of birds are those?”\n",
            "   “The birds of forever, the small beasts of an Immaculate Musical Conception. Something,” said Fentriss, “has made them with child and its name is song—”\n",
            "   “Hogwash!”\n",
            "   “Is it?! Something in the air, in the seeds they ate at dawn, some whim of climate and weather, God! But now theyre mine, its mine. A fine tune.”\n",
            "   “It is” said Black. “But cant be!”\n",
            "   “Never question the miraculous when it happens. Good grief, maybe those damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible songs for months, years, but no one listened. Today, for the first time, someone did. Me! Now, what to do with the gift?”\n",
            "   “You dont seriously mean-?”\n",
            "   “Ive been out of work for a year. I quit my computers, retired early, Im only forty-nine, and have been threatening to knit macrame” to give friends to spoil their walls, day after day. Which shall it be, friend, macrame” or Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Are you Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Just his bastard son.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense,” cried Black, pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the trees as if he might blast the choir. “That tree, those birds, are a Rorschach test. Your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from pure chaos. Theres no discernible tune, no special rhythm. You had me fooled, but I see and hear it now: youve had a repressed desire since childhood to compose. And youve let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by the ears. Put down that pen!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense right back at you.” Fentriss laughed. “Youre jealous that after twelve layabout years, thunderstruck with boredom, one of us has found an occupation. I shall follow it. Listen and write, write and listen. Sit down, youre obstructing the acoustics!”\n",
            "   “Ill sit,” Black exclaimed, “but—” He clapped his hands over his ears.\n",
            "   “Fair enough,” said Fentriss. “Escape fantastic reality while I change a few notes and finish out this unexpected birth.”\n",
            "   Glancing up at the tree, he whispered:\n",
            "   “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   The tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet.\n",
            "   “Crazy,” muttered Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One, two, three hours later, entering the library quietly and then loudly, Black cried out:\n",
            "   “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   Bent over his desk, his hand moving furiously, Fentriss said:\n",
            "   “Finishing a symphony!”\n",
            "   “The same one you began in the garden?”\n",
            "   “No, the birds began, the birds!”\n",
            "   “The birds, then.” Black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions. “How do you know what to do with that stuff?”\n",
            "   “They did most. Ive added variations!”\n",
            "   “An arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack. Have you composed before?”\n",
            "   “Not”-Fentriss let his fingers roam, loop, and scratch-“until today!”\n",
            "   “You realize, of course, youre plagiarizing those songbirds?”\n",
            "   “Borrowing, Black, borrowing. If a milkmaid, singing at dawn, can have her hum borrowed by Berlioz, well! Or if Dvorak, hearing a Dixie banjo plucker pluck “Goin” Home,” steals the banjo to eke out his New World, why cant I weave a net to catch a tune? There! Finito. Done! Give us a title, Black!”\n",
            "   “I? Who sings off-key?”\n",
            "   “What about “The Emperors Nightingale”?”\n",
            "   “Stravinsky.”\n",
            "   “The Birds”?”\n",
            "   “Hitchcock.”\n",
            "   “Damn. Hows this: “Its Only John Cage in a Gilded Bird”?”\n",
            "   “Brilliant. But no one knows who John Cage was.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, Ive got it!” And he wrote:\n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies Baked in a Pie.”\n",
            "   “Blackbirds, you mean; go back to John Cage.”\n",
            "   “Bosh!” Fentriss stabbed the phone. “Hello, Willie? Could you come over? Yes, a small job. Symphonic arrangement for a friend, or friends. Whats your usual Philharmonic fee? Eh? Good enough. Tonight!”\n",
            "   Fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonder in it.\n",
            "   “What next?” he murmured.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies,” with title shortened, premiered at the Glendale Chamber Symphony a month later with standing ovations, incredible reviews.\n",
            "   Fentriss, outside his skin with joy, prepared to launch himself atop large, small, symphonic, operatic, whatever fell on his ears. He had listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks, but bad noted nothing, waiting to see if the “Magpie” experiment was to be repeated. When the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they werent skipping, he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy ceased.\n",
            "   There followed: “Wings,” “Flight,” “Night Chorus,” “The Fledgling Madrigals,” and “Dawn Patrol,” each greeted by new thunderstorms of acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise.\n",
            "   “By now,” said Fentriss, “I should be unbearable to live with, but the birds caution modesty.”\n",
            "   “Also,” said Black, seated under the tree, waiting for a sprig of benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna, “shut up! If all those sly dimwit composers, who will soon be lurking in the bushes, cop your secret, youre a gone poacher.”\n",
            "   “Poacher! By God, yes!” Fentriss laughed. “Poacher.”\n",
            "   And damn if the first poacher didnt arrive!\n",
            "   Glancing out at tree in the morning, Fentriss witnessed a runty shadow stretching up, handheld tape recorder poised, warbling and whistling softly at the tree. when this failed, the half-seen poacher tried dove-coos and then orioles and roosters, half dancing in a circle.\n",
            "   “Damn it to hell!” Fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry: “Is that Wolfgang Prouty poaching my garden? Out, Wolfgang! Go!”\n",
            "   Dropping his recorder, Prouty vaulted a bush, impaled himself on thorns, and vanished.\n",
            "   Fentriss, cursing, picked up an abandoned notepad.\n",
            "   “Nightsong,” it read. On the tape recorder he found a lovely Satie-like bird-choir.\n",
            "   After that, more poachers arrived mid-night to depart at dawn. Their spawn, Fentriss realized, would soon throttle his creativity and still his voice. He loitered full-time in the garden now, not knowing what seed to give his beauties, and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up worms. Wearily he stood guard through sleepless nights, nodding off only to find Wolfgang Proutys evil minions astride the wall, prompting arias, and one night, by God, perched in the tree itself, humming in hopes of sing-alongs.\n",
            "   A shotgun was the final answer. After its first fiery roar, the garden was empty for a week. That is, until-\tSomeone came very late indeed and committed mayhem.\n",
            "   As quietly as possible, he cut the branches and sawed the limbs.\n",
            "   “Oh, envious composers, dreadful murderers!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   And the birds were gone.\n",
            "   And the career of Amadeus Two with it.\n",
            "   “Black!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Yes, dear friend?” said Black, looking at the bleak sky where once green was.\n",
            "   “Is your car outside?”\n",
            "   “When last I looked.”\n",
            "   “Drive!”\n",
            "   But driving in search didnt do it. It wasnt like calling in lost dogs or telephone-poled cats. They must find and cage an entire Mormon tabernacle team of soprano springtime-in-the-Rockies birdseed lovers to prove one in the hand is worth two in the bush.\n",
            "   But still they hastened from block to block, garden to garden, lurking and listening. Now their spirits soared with an echo of “Hallelujah Chorus” oriole warbling, only to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of despair.\n",
            "   Only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt and greens did one of them finally (Black) light his pipe and emit a theory.\n",
            "   “Did you ever think to wonder,” he mused behind a smoke-cloud, “what season of the year this is?”\n",
            "   “Season of the year?” said Fentriss, exasperated.\n",
            "   “Well, coincidentally, wasnt the night the tree fell and the wee songsters blew town, was not that the first fall night of autumn?”\n",
            "   Fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow.\n",
            "   “You mean?”\n",
            "   “Your friends have flown the coop. Their migration must be above San Miguel Allende just now.”\n",
            "   “If they are migratory birds!”\n",
            "   “Do you doubt it?”\n",
            "   Another pained silence, another blow to the head.\n",
            "   “Shit!”\n",
            "   “Precisely,” said Black.\n",
            "   “Friend,” said Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Sir?”\n",
            "   “Drive home.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was a long year, it was a short year, it was a year of anticipation, it was the burgeoning of despair, it was the revival of inspiration, but at its heart, Fentriss knew, just another Tale of Two Cities, but he did not know what the other city was!\n",
            "   How stupid of me, he thought, not to have guessed or imagined that my songsters were wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime swarmed north in A Cappella choirs of sound.\n",
            "   “The waiting,” he told Black, “is madness. The phone never stops—”\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up and addressed it like a child. “Yes. Yes. Of course. Soon. When? Very soon.” And put the phone down. “You see? That was Philadelphia. They want another Cantata as good as the first. At dawn today it was Boston. Yesterday the Vienna Philharmonic. Soon, I say. When? God knows. Lunacy! Where are those angels that once sang me to my rest?”\n",
            "   He threw down maps and weather charts of Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and the Argentines.\n",
            "   “How far south? Do I scour Buenos Aires or Rio, Mazatlan or Cuernavaca? And then? Wander about with a tin ear, standing under trees waiting for bird-drops like a spotted owl? Will the Argentine critics trot by scoffing to see me leaning on trees, eyes shut, waiting for the quasi-melody, the lost chord? Id let no one know the cause of my journey, my search, otherwise pandemoniums of laughter. But in what city, under what kind of tree would I wander to stand? A tree like mine? Do they seek the same roosts? or will anything do in Ecuador or Peru? God, I could waste months guessing and come back with birdseed in my hair and bird bombs on my lapels. What to do, Black? Speak!”\n",
            "   “Well, for one thing”-Black stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his aromatic concepts—” “you might clear off this stump and plant a new tree.”\n",
            "   They had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration. Fentriss froze with one foot raised. “Say that again?!”\n",
            "   “I said—”\n",
            "   “Good grief, you genius! Let me kiss you!”\n",
            "   “Rather not. Hugs, maybe.”\n",
            "   Fentriss hugged him, wildly. “Friend!”\n",
            "   “Always was.”\n",
            "   “Lets get a shovel and spade.”\n",
            "   “You get. Ill watch.”\n",
            "   Fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax.\n",
            "   “Sure you wont join me?”\n",
            "   Black sucked his pipe, blew smoke. “Later.”\n",
            "   “How much would a full-grown tree cost?”\n",
            "   “Too much.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but if it were here and the birds did return?” Black let out more smoke. “Might be worth it. Opus Number Two: “In the Beginning” by Charles Fentriss, stuff like that.”\n",
            "   “In the Beginning,” or maybe “The Return. “”\n",
            "   “One of those.”\n",
            "   “Or—” Fentriss struck the stump with the pickax. ““Rebirth. ““He struck again. “Ode to Joy. ““Another strike.\n",
            "   “Spring Harvest. ““Another. “Let the Heavens Resound. “Hows that, Black?”\n",
            "   “I prefer the other,” said Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The stump was pulled and the new tree bought.\n",
            "   “Dont show me the bill,” Fentriss told his accountant. “Pay it.”\n",
            "   And the tallest tree they could find, of the same family as the one dead and gone, was planted.\n",
            "   “What if it dies before my choir returns?” said Fentriss. “What if it lives,” said Black, “and your choir goes elsewhere?”\n",
            "   The tree, planted, seemed in no immediate need to die. Neither did it look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far southern places.\n",
            "   Meanwhile, the sky, like the tree, was empty. “Dont they know Im waiting?” said Fentriss. “Not unless,” offered Black, “you majored in cross-continental telepathy.”\n",
            "   “Ive checked with Audubon. They say that while the swallows do come back to Capistrano on a special day, give or take a white lie, other migrating species are often one or two weeks late.”\n",
            "   “If I were you,” said Black, “I would plunge into an intense love affair to distract you while you wait.”\n",
            "   “I am fresh out of love affairs.”\n",
            "   “Well, then,” said Black, “suffer.”\n",
            "   The hours passed slower than the minutes, the days passed slower than the hours, the weeks passed slower than the days. Black called. “No birds?”\n",
            "   “No birds.”\n",
            "   “Pity. I cant stand watching you lose weight.” And Black disconnected.\n",
            "   On a final night, when Fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the wall, fearful of another call from the Boston Symphony, he leaned an ax against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky.\n",
            "   “Last chance,” he said. “If the dawn patrol doesnt show by seven a. m., its quits.”\n",
            "   And he touched ax-blade against the tree-bole, took two shots of vodka so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes, and went to bed.\n",
            "   He awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze outside his window, stirring the leaves, with not a ghost of song.\n",
            "   And awoke at dawn with tear-filled eyes, having dreamed that the birds had returned, but knew, in waking, it was only a dream.\n",
            "   And yet...?\n",
            "   Hark, someone might have said in an old novel. List! as in an old play.\n",
            "   Eyes shut, he fine-tuned his ears .\n",
            "   The tree outside, as he arose, looked fatter, as if it had taken on invisible ballasts in the night. There were stirrings there, not of simple breeze or probing winds, but of something in the very leaves that knitted and purled them in rhythms. He dared not look but lay back down to ache his senses and try to know.\n",
            "   A single chirp hovered in the window.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Go on, he thought.\n",
            "   Another chirp.\n",
            "   Dont breathe, he thought; dont let them know youre listening.\n",
            "   Hush.\n",
            "   A fourth sound, then a fifth note, then a sixth and seventh. My God, he thought, is this a substitute orchestra, a replacement choir come to scare off my loves?\n",
            "   Another five notes.\n",
            "   Perhaps, he prayed, theyre only tuning up!\n",
            "   Another twelve notes, of no special timbre or pace, and as he was about to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunch-It happened. Note after note, line after line, fluid melody following spring freshet melody, the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous proclamations of return and welcome in chorus.\n",
            "   And as they sang, Fentriss sneaked his hand to find a pad and pen to hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir that soared and dipped to soar again, firing the bright air that flowed from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to remember.\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up swiftly to hear Black ask\n",
            "   if the waiting was over. Without speaking, he held the receiver in the window.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Blacks voice.\n",
            "   “No, anointed,” whispered the composer, scribbling Cantata No. 2. Laughing, he called softly to the sky.\n",
            "   “Please. More slowly. Legato, not agitato.”\n",
            "   And the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed.\n",
            "   Agitato ceased.\n",
            "   Legato prevailed.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "EXCHANGE\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There were too many cards in the file, too many books on the shelves, too many children laughing in the childrens room, too many newspapers to fold and stash on the racks... \n",
            "   All in all, too much. Miss Adams pushed her gray hair back over her lined brow, adjusted her gold-rimmed pince-nez, and rang the small silver bell on the library desk, at the same time switching off and on all the lights. The exodus of adults and children was exhausting. Miss Ingraham, the assistant librarian, had gone home early because her father was sick, so it left the burden of stamping, filing, and checking books squarely on Miss Adams” shoulders.\n",
            "   Finally the last book was stamped, the last child fed through the great brass doors, the doors locked, and with immense weariness, Miss Adams moved back up through a silence of forty years of books and being keeper of the books, stood for a long moment by the main desk.\n",
            "   She laid her glasses down on the green blotter, and pressed the bridge of her small-boned nose between thumb and forefinger and held it, eyes shut. What a racket! Children who finger-painted or cartooned frontispieces or rattled their roller skates. High school students arriving with laughters, departing with mindless songs!\n",
            "   Taking up her rubber stamp, she probed the files, weeding out errors, her fingers whispering between Dante and Darwin.\n",
            "   A moment later she heard the rapping on the front-door glass and saw a mans shadow outside, wanting in. She shook her head. The figure pleaded silently, making gestures.\n",
            "   Sighing, Miss Adams opened the door, saw a young man in uniform, and said, “Its late. Were closed.” She glanced at his insignia and added, “Captain.”\n",
            "   “Hold on!” said the captain. “Remember me?”\n",
            "   And repeated it, as she hesitated.\n",
            "   “Remember?”\n",
            "   She studied his face, trying to bring light out of shadow. “Yes, I think I do,” she said at last. “You once borrowed books here.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Many years ago,” she added. “Now I almost have you placed.”\n",
            "   As he stood waiting she tried to see him in those other years, but his younger face did not come clear, or a name with it, and his hand reached out now to take hers.\n",
            "   “May I come in?”\n",
            "   “Well.” She hesitated. “Yes.”\n",
            "   She led the way up the steps into the immense twilight of books. The young officer looked around and let his breath out slowly, then reached to take a book and hold it to his nose, inhaling, then almost laughing.\n",
            "   “Dont mind me, Miss Adams. You ever smell new books? Binding, pages, print. Like fresh bread when youre hungry.” He glanced around. “Im hungry now, but dont even know what for.”\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence, so she asked him how long he might stay.\n",
            "   “Just a few hours. Im on the train from New York to L. A., so I came up from Chicago to see old places, old friends.” His eyes were troubled and he fretted his cap, turning it in his long, slender fingers.\n",
            "   She said gently, “Is anything wrong? Anything I can help you with?”\n",
            "   He glanced out the window at the dark town, with just a few lights in the windows of the small houses across the way.\n",
            "   “I was surprised,” he said.\n",
            "   “By what?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what I expected. Pretty damn dumb,” he said, looking from her to the windows, “to expect that when I went away, everyone froze in place waiting for me to come home. That when I stepped off the train, all my old pals would unfreeze, run down, meet me at the station. Silly.”\n",
            "   “No,” she said, more easily now. “I think we all imagine that. I visited Paris as a young girl, went back to France when I was forty, and was outraged that no one had waited, buildings had vanished, and all the hotel staff where I had once lived had died, retired, or traveled.”\n",
            "   He nodded at this, but could not seem to go on.\n",
            "   “Did anyone know you were coming?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I wrote a few, but no answers. I figured, hell, theyre busy, but theyll be there. They werent.”\n",
            "   She felt the next words come off her lips and was faintly surprised. “Im still here,” she said.\n",
            "   “You are,” he said with a quick smile. “And I cant tell you how glad I am.”\n",
            "   He was gazing at her now with such intensity that she had to look away. “You know,” she said, “I must confess you look familiar, but I dont quite fit your face with the boy who came here—”\n",
            "   “Twenty years ago! And as for what he looked like, that other one, me, well—”\n",
            "   He brought out a smallish wallet which held a dozen pictures and handed over a photograph of a boy perhaps twelve years old, with an impish smile and wild blond hair, looking as if he might catapult out of the frame.\n",
            "   “Ah, yes.” Miss Adams adjusted her pince-nez and closed her eyes to remember. “That one. Spaulding. William Henry Spaulding?”\n",
            "   He nodded and peered at the picture in her hands anxiously.\n",
            "   “Was I a lot of trouble?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” She nodded and held the picture closer and glanced up at him. “A fiend.” She handed the picture back. “But I loved you.”\n",
            "   “Did you?” he said and smiled more broadly.\n",
            "   “In spite of you, yes.”\n",
            "   He waited a moment and then said, “Do you still love me?”\n",
            "   She looked to left and right as if the dark stacks held the answer.\n",
            "   “Its a little early to know, isnt it?”\n",
            "   “Forgive.”\n",
            "   “No, no, a good question. Time will tell. Lets not stand like your frozen friends who didnt move. Come along. Ive just had some late-night coffee. There may be some left. Give me your cap. Take off that coat. The file index is there. Go look up your old library cards for the hell-heck-of it.”\n",
            "   “Are they still there?” In amaze.\n",
            "   “Librarians save everything. You never know whos coming in on the next train. Go.”\n",
            "   When she came back with the coffee, he stood staring down into the index file like a bird fixing its gaze on a half-empty nest. He handed her one of the old purple-stamped cards.\n",
            "   “Migawd,” he said, “I took out a lot of books.”\n",
            "   “Ten at a time. I said no, but you took them. And,” she added, “read them! Here.” She put his cup on top of the file and waited while he drew out canceled card after card and laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “I cant believe. I must not have lived anywhere else but here. May I take this with me, to sit?” He showed the cards. She nodded. “Can you show me around? I mean, maybe Ive forgotten something.”\n",
            "   She shook her head and took his elbow. “I doubt that. Come on. Over here, of course, is the adult section.”\n",
            "   “I begged you to let me cross over when I was thirteen. “Youre not ready,” you said. But—”\n",
            "   “I let you cross over anyway?”\n",
            "   “You did. And much thanks.”\n",
            "   Another thought came to him as he looked down at her.\n",
            "   “You used to be taller than me,” he said.\n",
            "   She looked up at him, amused.\n",
            "   “Ive noticed that happens quite often in my life, but I can still do this.”\n",
            "   Before he could move, she grabbed his chin in her thumb and forefinger and held tight. His eyes rolled.\n",
            "   He said:\n",
            "   “I remember. When I was really bad youd hold on and put your face down close and scowl. The scowl did it. After ten seconds of your holding my chin very tight, I behaved for days.”\n",
            "   She nodded, released his chin. He rubbed it and as they moved on he ducked his head, not looking at her.\n",
            "   “Forgive, I hope you wont be upset, but when I was a boy I used to look up and see you behind your desk, so near but far away, and, how can I say this, I used to think that you were Mrs. God, and that the library was a whole world, and that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing I wanted to see and read, youd find and give it to me.” He stopped, his face coloring. “You did, too. You had the world ready for me every time I asked. There was always a place I hadnt seen, a country I hadnt visited where you took me. Ive never forgotten.”\n",
            "   She looked around, slowly, at the thousands of books. She felt her heart move quietly. “Did you really call me what you just said?”\n",
            "   “Mrs. God? Oh, yes. Often. Always.”\n",
            "   “Come along,” she said at last.\n",
            "   They walked around the rooms together and then downstairs to the newspaper files, and coming back up, he suddenly leaned against the banister, holding tight.\n",
            "   “Miss Adams,” he said.\n",
            "   “What is it, Captain?”\n",
            "   He exhaled. “Im scared. I dont want to leave. Im afraid.”\n",
            "   Her hand, all by itself, took his arm and she finally said, there in the shadows, “Sometimes-Im afraid, too. What frightens you?”\n",
            "   “I dont want to go away without saying good-bye. If I never return, I want to see all my friends, shake hands, slap them on the back, I dont know, make jokes.” He stopped and waited, then went on. “But I walk around town and nobody knows me. Everyones gone.”\n",
            "   The pendulum on the wall clock slid back and forth, shining, with the merest of sounds.\n",
            "   Hardly knowing where she was going, Miss Adams took his arm and guided him up the last steps, away from the marble vaults below, to a final, brightly decorated room, where he glanced around and shook his head.\n",
            "   “Theres no one here, either.”\n",
            "   “Do you believe that?”\n",
            "   “Well, where are they? Do any of my old pals ever come visit, borrow books, bring them back late?”\n",
            "   “Not often,” she said. “But listen. Do you realize Thomas Wolfe was wrong?”\n",
            "   “Wolfe? The great literary beast? Wrong?”\n",
            "   “The title of one of his books.”\n",
            "   “You Cant Go Home Again?” he guessed.\n",
            "   “Thats it. He was wrong. This is home. Your friends are still here. This was your summer place.”\n",
            "   “Yes. Myths. Legends. Mummies. Aztec kings. Wicked sisters who spat toads. Where I really lived. But I dont see my people.”\n",
            "   “Well.”\n",
            "   And before he could speak, she switched on a green-shaded lamp that shed a private light on a small table.\n",
            "   “Isnt this nice?” she said. “Most libraries today, too much light. There should be shadows, dont you think? Some mystery, yes? So that late nights the beasts can prowl out of the stacks and crouch by this jungle light to turn the pages with their breath. Am I crazy?”\n",
            "   “Not that I noticed.”\n",
            "   “Good. Sit. Now that I know who you are, it all comes back.”\n",

            "   “No? Youll see.”\n",
            "   She vanished into the stacks and came out with ten books that she placed upright, their pages a trifle spread so they could stand and he could read the titles.\n",

            "   “Oz? Dorothy? The Wizard? Oh, yes.”\n",
            "   She placed still others nearby. “Alice in Wonderland. Through the Looking-Glass. A month later you reborrowed both. “But,” I said, “youve already read them!” “But,” you said, “not enough so I can speak. I want to be able to tell them out loud.”\n",
            "   “My God,” he said quietly, “did I say that?”\n",
            "   “You did. Heres more you read a dozen times. Greek myths, Roman, Egyptian. Norse myths, Chinese. You were ravenous.”\n",

            "   “Three dozen times! John Carter, Warlord of Mars, four dozen. My God, dear lady, how come you remember all this?”\n",
            "   “You never left. Summertimes you were here when I unlocked the doors. You went home for lunch but sometimes brought sandwiches and sat out by the stone lion at noon. Your father pulled you home by your ear some nights when you stayed late. How could I forget a boy like that?”\n",
            "   “But still—”\n",
            "   “You never played, never ran out in baseball weather, or football, I imagine. Why?”\n",
            "   He glanced toward the front door. “They were waiting for me.”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know. The ones who never borrowed books, never read. They. Them. Those.”\n",
            "   She looked and remembered. “Ah, yes. The bullies. Why did they chase you?”\n",
            "   “Because they knew I loved books and didnt much care for them.”\n",
            "   “Its a wonder you survived. I used to watch you getting, reading hunchbacked, late afternoons. You looked so lonely.”\n",
            "   “No. I had these. Company.”\n",
            "   “Heres more.”\n",
            "   She put down Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and Treasure Island.\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said, “and dear and strange Mr. Poe. How I loved his Red Death.”\n",
            "   “You took it so often I told you to keep it on permanent loan unless someone else asked. Someone did, six months later, and when you brought it in I could see it was a terrible blow. A few days later I let you have Poe for another year. I dont recall, did you ever-?”\n",
            "   “Its out in California. Shall I—”\n",
            "   “No, no. Please. Well, here are your books. Let me bring others.”\n",

            "   She began to make a circle inside the other Stonehenge circle and as she placed the books, in lonely splendor, he said their names and then the names of the authors who had written them and then the names of those who had sat across from him so many years ago and read the books quietly or sometimes whispered the finest parts aloud, so beautifully that no one said Quiet or Silence or even Shh!\n",
            "   She placed the first book and there was a wild field of broom and a wind blowing a young woman across that field as it began to snow and someone, far away, called “Kathy” and as the snows fell he saw a girl he had walked to school in the sixth grade seated across the table, her eyes fixed to the windblown field and the snow and the lost woman in another time of winter.\n",
            "   A second book was set in place and a black and beauteous horse raced across a summer field of green and on that horse was another girl, who hid behind the book and dared to pass him notes when he was twelve.\n",
            "   And then there was the far ghost with a snow-maiden face whose hair was a long golden harp played by the summer airs; she who was always sailing to Byzantium where Emperors were drowsed by golden birds that sang in clockwork cages at sunset and dawn. She who always skirted the outer rim of school and went to swim in the deep lake ten thousand afternoons ago and never came out, so was never found, but suddenly now she made landfall here in the green-shaded light and opened Yeats to at last sail home from Byzantium.\n",
            "   And on her right: John Huff, whose name came clearer than the rest, who claimed to have climbed every tree in town and fallen from none, who had raced through watermelon patches treading melons, never touching earth, to knock down rainfalls of chestnuts with one blow, who yodeled at your sun-up window and wrote the same Mark Twain book report in four different grades before the teachers caught on, at which he said, vanishing, “Just call me Huck.”\n",
            "   And to his right, the pale son of the town hotel owner who looked as if he had gone sleepless forever, who swore every empty house was haunted and took you there to prove it, with a juicy tongue, compressed nose, and throat gargling that sounded the long October demise, the terrible and unutterable fall of the House of Usher.\n",
            "   And next to him was yet another girl.\n",
            "   And next to her... \n",
            "   And just beyond... \n",
            "   Miss Adams placed a final book and he recalled the fair creature, long ago, when such things were left unsaid, glancing up at him one day when he was an unknowing twelve and she was a wise thirteen to quietly say: “I am Beauty. And you, are you the Beast?”\n",
            "   Now, late in time, he wanted to answer that small and wondrous ghost: “No. He hides in the stacks and when the clock strikes three, will prowl forth to drink.”\n",
            "   And it was finished, all the books were placed, the outer ring of his selves and the inner ring of remembered faces, deathless, with summer and autumn names.\n",
            "   He sat for a long moment and then another long moment and then, one by one, reached for and took all of the books that had been his, and still were, and opened them and read and shut them and took another until he reached the end of the outer circle and then went to touch and turn and find the raft on the river, the field of broom where the storms lived, and the pasture with the black and beauteous horse and its lovely rider. Behind him, he heard the lady librarian quietly back away to leave him with words .\n",
            "   A long while later he sat back, rubbed his yes, and looked around at the fortress, the encirclement, the Roman encampment of books, and nodded, his eyes wet.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   He heard her move behind him.\n",

            "   “Nothing will as long as I can help it,,, she said.\n",
            "   “Dont ever go away.”\n",
            "   “I wont if youll come back more often.”\n",
            "   Just then, from below the town, not so very far off, a train whistle blew. She said:\n",
            "   “Is that yours?”\n",
            "   “No, but the one soon after,” he said and got up and moved around the small monuments that stood very tall and one by one, shut the covers, his lips moving to sound the old titles and the old, dear names.\n",
            "   “Do we have to put them back on the shelves?” he said. She looked at him and at the double circle and after a long moment said, “Tomorrow will do. Why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” he said, “during the night, because of the color of those lamps, green, the jungle, maybe those creatures you mentioned will come out and turn the pages with their breath. And maybe—”\n",
            "   “What else?”\n",
            "   “Maybe my friends, whove hid in the stacks all these years, will come out, too. “,\n",
            "   “Theyre already here,” she said quietly.\n",
            "   “Yes.” He nodded. “They are.”\n",
            "   And still he could not move.\n",
            "   She backed off across the room without making any sound, and when she reached her desk she called back, the last call of the night.\n",
            "   “Closing time. Closing time, children.”\n",
            "   And turned the lights quickly off and then on and then halfway between; a library twilight.\n",
            "   He moved from the table with the double circle of books and came to her and said, “I Can go now.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said. “William Henry Spaulding. You can.” They walked together as she turned out the lights, turned out the lights, one by one. She helped him into his coat and\n",
            "   then, hardly thinking to do so, he took her hand and kissed her fingers.\n",
            "   It was so abrupt, she almost laughed, but then she said, “Remember what Edith Whanon said when Henry James did what you just did?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “The flavor starts at the elbow.”\n",
            "   They broke into laughter together and he turned and went down the marble steps toward the stained-glass entry. At the bottom of the stairs he looked up at her and said:\n",
            "   “Tonight, when youre going to sleep, remember what I called you when I was twelve, and say it out loud.”\n",
            "   “I dont remember,” she said.\n",
            "   “Yes, you do.”\n",
            "   Below the town, a train whistle blew again.\n",
            "   He opened the front door, stepped out, and he was gone. Her hand on the last light switch, looking in at the double circle of books on the far table, she thought: What was it he called me?\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” she said a moment later.\n",
            "   And switched off the light.\n",

            "   The cemetery was in the center of the city. On four sides it was bounded by gliding streetcars on glistening blue tracks and cars with exhaust fumes and sound. But, once inside the wall, the world was lost. For half a mile in four directions the cemetery raised midnight trees and headstones that grew from the earth, like pale mushrooms, moist and cold. A gravel path led back into darkness and within the gate stood a Gothic Victorian house with six gables and a cupola. The front-porch light showed an old man there alone, not smoking, not reading, not moving, silent. If you took a deep breath he smelled of the sea, of urine, of papyrus, of kindling, of ivory, and of teak. His false teeth moved his mouth automatically when it wanted to talk. His tiny yellow seed eyes twitched and his poke-hole nostrils thinned as a stranger crunched up the gravel path and set foot on the porch step.\n",
            "   “Good evening!” said the stranger, a young man, perhaps twenty.\n",
            "   The old man nodded, but his hands lay quietly on his knees “I saw that sign out front,” the stranger went on. “FREE DIRT, it said.”\n",
            "   The old man almost nodded.\n",
            "   The stranger tried a smile. “Crazy, but that sign caught my eye.\n",
            "   There was a glass fan over the front door. A light shone through this glass fan, colored blue, red, yellow, and touched the old mans face. It seemed not to bother him.\n",
            "   “I wondered, free dirt? Never struck me youd have much left over. When you dig a hole and put the coffin in and refill the hole, you havent much dirt left, have you? I should think...”\n",
            "   The old man leaned forward. It was so unexpected that the stranger pulled his foot off the bottom step.\n",
            "   “You want some?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Why, no, no, I was just curious. Signs like that make you curious.”\n",
            "   “Set down,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Thanks.” The young man sat uneasily on the steps. “You know how it is, you walk around and never think how it is to own a graveyard.”\n",
            "   “And?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “I mean, like how much time it takes to dig graves.”\n",
            "   The old man leaned back in his chair. “On a cool day:\n",
            "   two hours. Hot day, four. Very hot day, six. Very cold day, not cold so it freezes, but real cold, a man can dig a grave in one hour so he can head in for hot chocolate, brandy in the chocolate. Then again, you get a good man on a hot day, hes no better than a bad man in the cold. Might take eight hours to open up, but heres easy-digging soil here. All loam, no rocks.”\n",
            "   “Im curious about winter.”\n",
            "   “In blizzards we got a icebox mausoleum to stash the dead, undelivered mail, until spring and a whole month of shovels and spades.”\n",
            "   “Seeding and planting time, eh?” The stranger laughed.\n",
            "   “You might say that.”\n",
            "   “Dont you dig in winter anyhow? For special funerals? Special dead?”\n",
            "   “Some yards got a hose-shovel contraption. Pump hot water through the blade; shape a grave quick, like placer mining, even with the ground an ice-pond. We dont cotton to that. Use picks and shovels.”\n",
            "   The young man hesitated. “Does it bother you?”\n",
            "   “You mean, I get scared ever?”\n",
            "   “Well... yes.”\n",
            "   The old man at last took out and stuffed his pipe with tobacco, tamped it with a callused thumb, lit it, let out a small stream of smoke.\n",
            "   “No,” he said at last.\n",
            "   The young mans shoulders sank. “Disappointed?” said the old man. “I thought maybe once .\n",
            "   “Oh, when youre young, maybe. One time... ”\n",
            "   “Then there was a time!” The young man shifted up a step. The old man glanced at him sharply, then resumed smoking. “One time.” He stared at the marbled hills and the dark trees. “My grandpa owned this yard. I was born here. A gravedigger” 5 son learns to ignore things.”\n",
            "   The old man took a number of deep puffs and said:\n",
            "   “I was just eighteen, folks off on vacation, me left to tend things, alone, mow the lawn, dig holes and such. Alone, four graves to dig in October and a cold came hard off the lake, frost on the graves, tombstones like snow, ground froze solid.\n",
            "   “One night I walked out. No moon. Hard grass underfoot, could see my breath, hands in my pockets, walking, listening.”\n",
            "   The old man exhaled frail ghosts from his thin nostrils. “Then I heard this sound, deep under. I froze. It was a voice, screaming. Someone woke up buried, heard me walk by, cried out. I just stood. They screamed and screamed. Earth banged. On a cold night, grounds like porcelain, rings, you see?\n",
            "   “Well—” The old man shut his eyes to remember. “I stood like the wind off the lake stopped my blood. A joke? I searched around and thought, Imagination! No, it was underfoot, sharp, clear. A womans voice. I knew all the gravestones.” The old mans eyelids trembled. “Could recite them alphabetical, year, month, day. Name any year, and Ill tell. How about 1899? Jake Smith departed. And 1923? Betty Dallman lost. And 1933? P. H. Moran! Name a month. August? August last year, buried Henrietta Wells. August 1918? Grandma Hanlon, whole family! Influenza! Name a day, August fourth? Smith, Burke, Shelby carried off. Williamson? Hes on that hill, pink marble. Douglas? By the creek... ”\n",
            "   “The story,” the young man urged.\n",
            "   “Eh?”\n",
            "   “The story you were telling.”\n",
            "   “Oh, the voice below? Well, I knew all the stones. Standing there, I guessed that voice out of the ground was Henrietta Fremwell, fine girl, twenty-four years, played piano at the Elite Theatre. Tall, graceful, blond. How did I know her voice? I stood where there was only mens graves. Hers was the only womans. I ran to put my ear on her stone. Yes! Her voice, way down, screaming!\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell!” I shouted.\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell,” I yelled again.\n",
            "   “Deep down I heard her, only weeping now. Maybe she heard me, maybe not. She just cried. I ran downhill so fast I tripped and split my head on a stone, got up, screamed myself! Got to the tool shed, all blood, dragged out the tools, and just stood there in the moonlight with one shovel. The ground was ice solid, solid. I fell back against a tree. It would take three minutes to get back to her grave, and eight hours of cold night to dig to her box. The ground was like glass. A coffin is a coffin; only so much space for air. Henrietta Fremwell had been buried two days before the freeze, been asleep all that time, using up air, and it rained just before the cold spell and the earth over her, soaked with rainwater now, froze. Id have to dig maybe eight hours. And the way she cried, there wasnt another hour of air left.”\n",
            "   The old mans pipe had gone out. He rocked in his chair, back and forth, back and forth, silently.\n",
            "   “But,” said the young man, “what did you do?”\n",
            "   “Nothing,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Nothing!?”\n",
            "   “Nothing I could do. That ground was solid. Six men couldnt have dug that grave. No hot water near. And she mightve been screaming hours before I heard, so...\n",
            "   “You did-nothing?”\n",
            "   “Something Put the shovel and pick back in the tool shed, locked it and went back to the house and built a fire and drank some hot chocolate, shivering and shivering. Would you have done different?”\n",
            "   “I—”\n",
            "   “Would you have dug for eight hours in hard ice rock sos to reach her when she was truly dead of exhaustion, cold, smothered, and have to bury her all over again? Then call her folks and tell them?”\n",
            "   The young man was silent. On the porch, the mosquitoes hummed about the naked light bulb.\n",
            "   “I see,” said the young man.\n",
            "   The old man sucked his pipe. “I think I cried all night because there was nothing I could do.” He opened his eyes and stared about, surprised, as if he had been listening to someone else.\n",
            "   “Thats quite a story,” said the young man.\n",
            "   “No,” said the old man, “Gods truth. Want to hear more? See that big stone with the ugly angel? That was Adam Crispins. Relatives fought, got a writ from a judge, dug him up hoping for poison. Found nothing. Put him back, but by that time the dirt from his grave mixed with other dirts. We shoveled in stuff from all around. Next plot, the angel with broken wings? Mary-Lou Phipps. Dug her up to lug her off to Elgin, Illinois. More relatives. Where shed been, the pit stayed open, oh, three weeks. No funerals. Meanwhile, her dirt got cross-shoveled with others. Six stones over, one stone north, that was Henry Douglas Jones. Became famous sixty years after no one paid attention. Now hes planted under the Civil War monument. His grave lay wide two months, nobody wanted to utilize the hole of a Southerner, all of us leaning North with Grant. So his dirt got scattered. That give you some notion of what that FREE DIRT sign means?”\n",

            "   The old man pointed with his pipe and the stranger looked and indeed, by a nearby wall was a sizable hillock some ten feet long by about three feet high, loam and grass tufts of many shades of tan, brown, and burnt umber.\n",
            "   “Go look,” said the old man.\n",
            "   The young man walked slowly over to stand by the mound.\n",

            "   “What?” said the old man, looking somewhere else.\n",
            "   The stranger listened and shook his head. “Nothing.”\n",

            "   “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Yes, you have,” said the old man, “or you wouldnt have driven your lightweight delivery truck up by the cemetery gate. I got cats ears. Heard your motor just when you stopped. How much?”\n",
            "   “Oh,” said the young man uneasily. “My backyards eighty feet by forty. I could use a good inch of topsoil. So... ?”\n",
            "   “Id say,” said the old man, “half of that mound there. Hell, take it all. Nobody wants it.”\n",
            "   “You mean—”\n",
            "   “I mean, that mound has been growing and diminishing, diminishing and growing, mixtures up and down, since Grant took Richmond and Sherman reached the sea. Theres Civil dirt there, coffin splinters, satin casket shreds from when Lafayette met the Honor Guards Edgar Allan Poe. Theres funeral flowers, blossoms from ten hundred obsequies. Condolence-card confetti for Hessian troopers, Parisian gunners who never shipped home. That soil is so laced with bone meal and casket corsages, I should charge you to buy the lot. Grab a spade before I do.”\n",
            "   “Stay right there.” The young man raised one hand.\n",

            "   “Graveyard spades best. Familiar metal, familiar soil. Easy digging when like takes to like. So.”\n",
            "   The old mans head indicated a spade half stuck in the dark mound. The young man shrugged and moved.\n",
            "   The cemetery spade came free with a soft whispering. Pellets of ancient mound fell with similar whispers.\n",
            "   He began to dig and shift and fill the back of his half-truck as the old man from the corners of his eyes observed:\n",
            "   “Its more than dirt, as I said. War of 1812, San Juan Hill, Manassas, Gettysburg, October flu epidemic 1918, all strewn from graves filled and evicted to be refilled. Various occupants leavened out to dust, various glories melted to mixtures, rust from metal caskets, coffin handles, shoelaces but no shoes, hairs long and short. Ever see wreaths made of hair saved to weave crowns to fix on mortal pictures? All thats left of a smile or that funny look in the eyes of someone who knows shes not alive anymore, ever. Hair, epaulettes, not whole ones, but one strand of epaulette, all there along with blood thats gone to silt.”\n",
            "   The young man finished, sweating, and started to thrust the spade back in the earth when the old man said:\n",
            "   “Take it. Cemetery dirt, cemetery spade, like takes to like.”\n",
            "   “Ill bring it back tomorrow.” The young man tossed the spade into the mounded truck.\n",
            "   “No. You got the dirt, so keep the spade. Just dont bring the free dirt back.”\n",
            "   “Why would I do that?”\n",
            "   “Just dont,” said the old man, but did not move as the young man climbed in his truck to start the engine.\n",

Back on the horizon, thunder sounded. A few drops of rain fell on the windshield, causing the young man to ram his foot on the gas and swerve into his home street even as the sun truly died, the wind rose, and the trees around his cottage bent and beckoned.\n",
            "   Climbing out, he stared at the sky and then his house and then the empty garden. A few drops of cold rain on his cheeks decided him; he drove the rattling half-truck into the empty garden, unlatched the metal back-flap, opened it just an inch so as to allow a proper flow, and then began motoring back and forth across the garden, letting the dark stuffs whisper down, letting the strange midnight earth sift and murmur, until at last the truck was empty and he stood in the blowing night, watching the wind stir the black soil.\n",
            "   Then he locked the truck in the garage and went to stand on the back porch, thinking, I wont need water. The storm will soak the ground.\n",

            "   At midnight the rain grew heavy. He looked to see if it was eroding the new dark earth but saw only the black muck drinking the downpour like a great black sponge, lit by distant flares of lightning.\n",
            "   Then, at one in the morning, the greatest Niagara of all shuddered the house, rinsed the windows to blindness, and shook the lights.\n",
            "   And then, abruptly, the downpour, the immense Niagara ceased, followed by one great downfell blow of lightning which plowed and pinioned the dark earth close by, near, outside, with explosions of light as if ten thousand flashbulbs had been fired off. Then darkness fell in curtains of thunder, cracking, breaking the bones.\n",
            "   In bed, wishing for the merest dog to hold for lack of human company, hugging the sheets, burying his head, then rising full to the silent air, the dark air, the storm gone, the rain shut, and a silence that spread in whispers as the last drench melted into the trembling soil.\n",
            "   He shuddered and then shivered and then hugged himself to stop the shivering of his cold flesh, and he was thirsty but could not make himself move to find the kitchen and drink water, milk, leftover wine, anything. He lay back, dry-mouthed, with unreasonable tears filling his eyes.\n",
            "   Free dirt, he thought. My God, what a damn-fool night. Free dirt!\n",
            "   At two oclock he heard his wristwatch ticking softly.\n",

He was a genius verging on the brilliant, unmarried, unengaged, with no children that he could honestly claim, so having nothing much else to do, woke one morning in the summer of 1999, weeping.\n",
            "   “Why!?”\n",
            "   Out of bed, he faced his mirror to watch the tears, examine his sadness, trace the woe. Like a child, curious after emotion, he charted his own map, found no capital city of despair, but only a vast and empty expanse of sorrow, and went to shave.\n",
            "   Which didnt help, for Harrison Cooper had stumbled on some secret supply of melancholy that, even as he shaved, spilled in rivulets down his soaped cheeks.\n",
            "   “Great God,” he cried. “Im at a funeral, but whos dead?!”\n",
            "   He ate his breakfast toast somewhat soggier than usual and plunged off to his laboratory to see if gazing at his Time Traveler would solve the mystery of eyes that shed rain while the rest of him stood fair.\n",

            "   For Harrison Cooper had spent the better part of his third decade wiring circuitries of impossible pasts and as yet untouchable futures. Most men philosophize in their as-beautiful-as-women cars. Harrison Cooper chose to dream and knock together from pure air and electric thunderclaps what he called his Mobius Machine.\n",
            "   He had told his friends, with wine-colored nonchalance, that he was taking a future strip and a past strip, giving them a now half twist, so they looped on a single plane. Like those figure-eight ribbons, cut and pasted by that dear mathematician A. F. Mobius in the nineteenth century.\n",
            "   “Ah, yes, Mobius,” friends murmured.\n",
            "   What they really meant was, “Ah, no. Good night.”\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper was not a mad scientist, but he was irretrievably boring. Knowing this, he had retreated to finish the Mobius Machine. Now, this strange morning, with cold rain streaming from his eyes, he stood staring at the damned contraption, bewildered that he was not dancing about with Creations joy.\n",
            "   He was interrupted by the ringing of the laboratory doorbell and opened the door to find one of those rare people, a real Western Union delivery boy on a real bike. He signed for the telegram and was about to shut the door when he saw the lad staring fixedly at the Mobius Machine.\n",
            "   “What,” exclaimed the boy, eyes wide, “is that?”\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper stood aside and let the boy wander in a great circle around his Machine, his eyes dancing up, over, and around the immense circling figure eight of shining copper, brass, and silver.\n",
            "   “Sure!” cried the boy at last, beaming. “A Time Machine!”\n",
            "   “Bulls-eye!”\n",

            "   Suddenly he knew why he had wept at dawn. He grabbed the young lads hand. “Much thanks. Youre a catalyst—”\n",

            "   “Cut the cackle and move the buns,” said Samuel. “Did you call to sermonize or ask advice?”\n",

            "   As if fallen from a delivery-chute, the books arrived almost before the footfalls and then the half-seen feet and then the fog-wrapped legs and body and at last the head of a man who, as the ribbon spiraled itself back into emptiness, crouched over the volumes as if warming himself at a hearth.\n",
            "   He touched the books and listened to the air in the dim hallway where dinnertime voices drifted up from below and a door stood wide near his elbow, from which the faint scent of illness came and went, arrived and departed, with the stilted breathing of some patient within the room. Plates and silverware sounded from the world of evening and quiet good health downstairs. The hall and the sickroom were for a time deserted. In a moment, someone might ascend with a tray for the half-sleeping man in the intemperate room.\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper rose with stealth, checking the stairwell, and then, carrying a sweet burden of books, moved into the room, where candles lit both sides of a bed on which the dying man lay supine, arms straight at his sides, head weighting the pillow, eyes grimaced shut, mouth set as if daring the ceiling, mortality itself, to sink and extinguish him.\n",
            "   At the first touch of the books, now on one side, now on the other, of his bed, the old mans eyelids fluttered, his dry lips cracked; the air whistled from his nostrils:\n",
            "   “whos there?” he whispered. “what time is it?”\n",
            "   “whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, then I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can,” replied the traveler at the foot of the bed, quietly.\n",
            "   “what, what?” the old man in the bed whispered swiftly. “It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation,” quoted the visitor, who now moved to place a book under each of the dying mans hands where his tremoring fingers could scratch, pull away, then touch, Braille-like, again.\n",
            "   One by one, the stranger held up book after book, to show the covers, then a page, and yet another title page where printed dates of this novel surfed up, adrift, but to stay forever on some far future shore.\n",
            "   The sick mans eyes lingered over the covers, the tides, the dates, and then fixed to his visitors bright face. He exhaled, stunned. “My God, you have the look of a traveler. From where?”\n",
            "   “Do the years show?” Harrison Cooper leaned forward. “Well, then-I bring you an Annunciation.”\n",
            "   “Such things come to pass only with virgins,” whispered the old man. “No virgin lies here buried under his unread books.”\n",
            "   “I come to unbury you. I bring tidings from a far place.” The sick mans eyes moved to the books beneath his trembling hands.\n",
            "   “Mine?” he whispered.\n",
            "   The traveler nodded solemnly, but began to smile when the color in the old mans face grew warmer arid the expression in his eyes and on his mouth was suddenly eager.\n",
            "   “Is there hope. then?”\n",
            "   “There is!”\n",
            "   “I believe you.” The old man took a breath and then wondered, “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because,” said the stranger at the foot of the bed, “I love you.”\n",
            "   “I do not know you, sir!”\n",
            "   “But I know you fore and aft, port to starboard, main topgallants to gunnels, every day in your long life to here!”\n",
            "   “Oh, the sweet sound!” cried the old man. “Every word that you say, every light from your eyes, is foundation-of-the-world true! How can it be?” Tears winked from the old mans lids. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because I am the truth,” said the traveler. “I have come a long way to find and say: you are not lost. Your great Beast has only drowned some little while. In another year, lost ahead, great and glorious, plain and simple men will gather at your grave and shout: he breeches, he rises, he breeches, he rises! and the white shape will surface to the light, the great terror lift into the storm and thunderous St. Elmos fire and you with him, each bound to each, and no way to tell where he stops and you start or where you stop and he goes off around the world lifting a fleet of libraries in his and your wake through nameless seas of sub-sub-librarians and readers mobbing the docks to chart your far journeyings, alert for your lost cries at three of a wild morn.”\n",
            "   “Christs wounds!” said the man in his winding-sheet bedclothes. “To the point, man, the point! Do you speak truth!?”\n",
            "   “I give you my hand on it, and pledge my soul and my hearts blood.” The visitor moved to do just this, and the two mens fists fused as one. “Take these gifts to the grave. Count these pages like a rosary in your last hours. Tell no one where they came from. Scoffers would knock the ritual beads from your fingers. So tell this rosary in the dark before dawn, and the rosary is this: you will live forever. You are immortal.”\n",
            "   “No more of this, no more! Be still.”\n",
            "   “I can not. Hear me. Where you have passed a fire path will burn, miraculous in the Bengal Bay, the Indian Seas, Hopes Cape, and around the Horn, past perditions landfall, as far as living eyes can see.”\n",
            "   He gripped the old mans fist ever more tightly.\n",
            "   “I swear. In the years ahead, a million millions will crowd your grave to sleep you well and warm your bones. Do you hear?”\n",
            "   “Great God, you are a proper priest to sound my Last Rites. And will I enjoy my own funeral? I will.”\n",
            "   His hands, freed, clung to the books at each side, as the ardent visitor raised yet other books and intoned the dates:\n",
            "   “Nineteen twenty-two... 1930... 1935... 1940 . 1955... 1970. Can you read and know what it means?”\n",
            "   He held the last volume close to the old mans face. The fiery eyes moved. The old mouth creaked.\n",
            "   “Nineteen ninety?”\n",
            "   “Yours. One hundred years from tonight.”\n",
            "   “Dear God!”\n",
            "   “I must go, but I would hear. Chapter One. Speak.”\n",
            "   The old mans eyes slid and burned. He licked his lips, traced the words, and at last whispered, beginning to weep:\n",
            "   “Call me Ishmael.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There was snow and more snow and more snow after that. In the dissolving whiteness, the silver ribbon twirled in a massive whisper to let forth in an exhalation of Time the journeying librarian and his book bag. As if slicing white bread rinsed by snow, the ribbon, as the traveler ghosted himself to flesh, sifted him through the hospital wall into a room as white as December. There, abandoned, lay a man as pale as the snow and the wind. Almost young, he slept with his mustaches oiled to his lip by fever. He seemed not to know nor care that a messenger had invaded the air near his bed. His eyes did not stir, nor did his mouth increase the passage of breath. His hands at his sides did not open to receive. He seemed already lost in a bomb and only his unexpected visitors voice caused his eyes to roll behind their shut lids.\n",

            "   In Paris, an hour, a day, a year, a minute later, there was a run of St. Elmos fire along a church steeple, a blue glow in a dark alley, a soft tread at a street corner, a turnabout of wind like an invisible carousel, and then footfalls up a stair to a door which opened on a bedroom where a window looked out upon cafes filled with people and far music, and in a bed by the window, a tall man lying, his pale face immobile, until he heard alien breath in his room.\n",
            "   The shadow of a man stood over him and now leaned down so that the light from the window revealed a face and a mouth as it inhaled and then spoke. The single word that the mouth said was:\n",

            "   \n",
            "   They drove into green Sunday-morning country, away from the hot aluminum city, and watched as the sky was set free and moved over them like a lake they had never known was there, amazingly blue and with white breakers above them as they traveled.\n",
            "   Clarence Travers slowed the car and felt the cool wind move over his face with the smell of cut grass. He reached over to grasp his wifes hand and glanced at his son and daughter in the backseat, not fighting, at least for this moment, as the car moved through one quiet beauty after another in what might be a Sunday so lush and green it would never end.\n",
            "   “Thank God were doing this,” said Cecelia Travers. “Its been a million years since we got away.” He felt her hand hug his and then relax completely. “when I think of all those ladies dropping dead from the heat at the cocktail parry this afternoon, welt”\n",
            "   “Well, indeed,” said Clarence Travers. “Onward!”\n",
            "   He pressed the gas pedal and they moved faster. Their progress out of the city had been mildly hysterical, with cars shrieking and shoving them toward islands of wilderness praying for picnics that might not be found. Seeing that he had put the car in the fast lane, he slowed to gradually move himself and his family through the banshee traffic until they were idling along at an almost reasonable fifty miles an hour. The scents of flowers and trees that blew in the window made his move worthwhile. He laughed at nothing at all and said:\n",
            "   “Sometimes, when I get this far out, I think lets just keep driving, never go back to the damned city.”\n",
            "   “Lets drive a hundred miles,” shouted his son.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” cried his daughter.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” said Clarence Travers. “But one slow mile at a time.” And then said, softly, “Hey!”\n",
            "   And as suddenly as if they had dreamed it up, the lost highway came into view. “Wonderful!” said Mr. Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “What?” asked the children.\n",
            "   “Look!” said Clarence Travers, leaning over his wife, pointing. “Thats the Old road. The one they used a long time ago.”\n",
            "   “That?” said his wife.\n",
            "   “Its awfully small,” said his son.\n",
            "   “Well, there werent many cars then, they didnt need much.”\n",
            "   “It looks like a big snake,” said his daughter.\n",
            "   “Yeah, the old roads used to twist and turn, all right. Remember?”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers nodded. The car had slowed and they gazed over at that narrow concrete strip with the green grass buckling it gently here or there and sprays of wildflowers nestling up close to either side and the morning sunlight coming down through the high elms and maples and oaks that led the way toward the forest.\n",
            "   “I know it like the nose on my face,” said Clarence Travers. “How would you like to ride on it?”\n",
            "   “Oh, Clarence, now\n",
            "   “I mean it.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Daddy, could we?”\n",
            "   “All right, well do it,” he said decisively.\n",
            "   “We cant!” said Cecelia Travers. “Its probably against the law. It cant be safe.”\n",
            "   But before his wife could finish, he turned off the freeway and let all the swift cars rush on while he drove, smiling at each bump, down over a small ditch, toward the old road.\n",
            "   “Clarence, please! well be arrested!”\n",
            "   “For going ten miles an hour on a highway nobody uses anymore? Lets not kick over any beehives, its too nice a day. Ill buy you all soda pops if you behave.”\n",
            "   They reached the old road.\n",
            "   “See how simple? Now which way, kids?”\n",
            "   “That way, that way!”\n",
            "   “Easy as pie!”\n",
            "   And he let the car take them away on the old highway, the great white-gray boa constrictor that lashed now slowly this way in green moss-velvet meadows, looped over gentle hills, and lowered itself majestically into caves of moist-smelling trees, through the odor of cricks and spring mud and crystal water that rustled like sheets of cellophane over small stone falls. They drove slow enough to see the waterspiders” enigmatic etchings on quiet pools behind dams of last Octobers leaves.\n",
            "   “Daddy, what are those?”\n",
            "   “What, the water-skaters? No one has ever caught one. You wait and wait and put your hand out and bang! The spiders gone. Theyre the first things in life you cant grab onto. The list gets bigger as you grow old, so start small. Dont believe in them. Theyre not really there.”\n",
            "   “Its fun thinking they are.”\n",
            "   “You have just stated a deep philosophical truth. Now, drive on, Mr. Travers.” And obeying his own command with good humor, he drove on.\n",
            "   And they came to a forest that had been like November all through the winter and now, reluctantly, was putting out green flags to welcome the season. Butterflies in great tosses of confetti leaped from the deeps of the forest to ramble drunkenly on the air, their thousand torn shadows following over grass and water.\n",
            "   “Lets go back now,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Aw, Mom,” said the son and daughter.\n",
            "   “Why?” said Clarence Travers. “My God, how many kids back in that damned hot town can say they drove on a road nobody else has used in years? Not one! Not one with a father brave enough to cross a little grass to take the old way. Right?”\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers lapsed into silence.\n",
            "   “Right there,” said Clarence Travers, “over that hill, the highway turns left, then right, then left again, an S curve, and another S. Wait and see.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “An S curve.”\n",
            "   The car purred.\n",
            "   “Another S!”\n",
            "   “Just like you said!”\n",
            "   “Look.” Clarence Travers pointed. A hundred yards across the way from them, the freeway suddenly appeared for a few yards before it vanished, screaming behind stacks of playing-card billboards. Clarence Travers stared fixedly at it and the grass between it and this shadowed path, this silent place like the bottom of an old stream where tides used to come but came no more, where the wind ran through nights making the old sound of far traffic.\n",
            "   “You know something,” said the wife. “That freeway over there scares me.”\n",
            "   “Can we drive home on this old road instead, Dad?” said the son.\n",
            "   “I wish we could.”\n",
            "   “Ive always been scared,” said the wife, watching that other traffic roaring by, gone before it arrived.\n",
            "   “Were all afraid,” said Clarence Travers. “But you pay your money and take your chance. Well?”\n",
            "   His wife sighed. “Damn, get back on that dreadful thing.”\n",
            "   “Not quite yet,” said Clarence Travers and drove to reach a small, very small village, all quite unexpected, a settlement no more than a dozen white clapboard houses mossed under giant trees, dreaming in a green tide of water and leaf-shadow, with wind shaking the rocking chairs on weathered porches and dogs sleeping in the cool nap of grass-carpeting at noon, and a small general store with a dirty red gas pump out front.\n",
            "   They drew up there and got out and stood, unreal in the sudden lack of motion, not quite accepting these houses lost in the wilderness.\n",
            "   The door to the general store squealed open and an old man stepped out, blinked at them, and said, “Say, did you folks just come down that old road?”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers avoided his wifes accusing eyes. “Yes, sir.\n",
            "   “No one on that road in twenty years.”\n",
            "   “We were out for a lark,” said Mr. Travers. “And found a peacock,” he added.\n",
            "   “A sparrow,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “The freeway passed us by, a mile over there, if you want it,” said the old man. “When the new road opened, this town just died on the vine. We got nothing here now but people like me. That is: old.”\n",
            "   “Looks like thered be places here to rent.”\n",
            "   “Mister, just walk in, knock out the bats, stomp the spiders, and any place is yours for thirty bucks a month. I own the whole town.”\n",
            "   “Oh, were not really interested,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Didnt think you would be,” said the old man. “Too far out from the city, too far off the freeway. And that dirt road there slops over when it rains, all muck and mud. And, heck, its against the law to use that path. Not that they ever patrol it.” The old man snorted, shaking his head. “And not that Ill turn you in. But it gave me a nice start just now to see you coming down that rut. J had to give a quick look at my calendar, by God, and make sure it wasnt 1929!”\n",
            "   Lord, I remember, thought Clarence Travers. This is Fox Hill. A thousand people lived here. I was a kid, we passed through on summer nights. We used to stop here late late, and me sleeping in the backseat in the moonlight. My grandmother and grandfather in back with me. Its nice to sleep in a car driving late and the road all white, watching the stars turn as you take the curves, listening to the grown-ups” voices underwater, remote, talking, talking, laughing, murmuring, whispering. My father driving, so stolid. Just to be driving in the summer dark, up along the lake to the Dunes, where the poison ivy grew out on the lonely beach and the wind stayed all the time and never went away. And us driving by that lonely graveyard place of sand and moonlight and poison ivy and the waves tumbling in like dusty ash on the shore, the lake pounding like a locomotive on the sand, coming and going. And me crumpled down and smelling Grandmothers wind-cooled coat and the voices comforting and blanketing me with their solidity and their always-will-be-here sounds that would go on forever, myself always young and us always riding on a summer night in our old Kissel with the side flaps down. And stopping here at nine or ten for Pistachio and Tutti-frutti ice cream that tasted, faintly, beautifully, of gasoline. All of us licking and biting the cones and smelling the gasoline and driving on, sleepy and snug, toward home, Green Town, thirty years ago.\n",
            "   He caught himself and said:\n",
            "   “About these houses, would it be much trouble fixing them up?” He squinted at the old man.\n",
            "   “Well, yes and no, most of “em over fifty years old, lots of dust. You could buy one off me for ten thousand, a real bargain now, youll admit. If you were an artist, now, a painter, or something like that.”\n",
            "   “I write copy in an advertising firm.”\n",
            "   “Write stories, too, no doubt? Well, now, you get a writer out here, quiet, no neighbors, youd do lots of writing.”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers stood silently between the old man and her husband. Clarence Travers did not look at her, but looked at the cinders around the porch of the general store. “I imagine I could work here.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Ive often thought,” said Mr. Travers, “its time we got away from the city and took it a little easy.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers said nothing but searched in her purse and took out a minor.\n",
            "   “Would you like some drinks?” asked Clarence Travers with exaggerated concern. “Three Orange Crushes, make it four,” he told the old man. The old man moved inside the store, which smelled of nails and crackers and dust.\n",
            "   When the old man was gone, Mr. Travers turned to his wife, and his eyes were shining. “Weve always wanted to do it! Lets!”\n",
            "   “Do what?” she said.\n",
            "   “Move out here, snap decision, why not? Why? Weve promised ourselves every year: get away from the noise, the confusion, so the kidsd have a place to play. And...\n",
            "   “Good grief” the wife cried.\n",
            "   The old man moved inside the store, coughing. “Ridiculous.” She lowered her voice. “Weve got the apartment paid up, youve got a fine job, the kids have school with friends, I belong to some fine clubs. And weve just spent a bundle redecorating. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen,” he said, as if she were really listening. “None of thats important. Out here, we can breathe. Back in town, hell, you complain... ”\n",
            "   “Just to have something to complain about.”\n",
            "   “Your clubs cant be that important.”\n",
            "   “Its not clubs, its friends!”\n",
            "   “How many would care if we dropped dead tomorrow?” he said. “If I got hit in that traffic, how many thousand cars would run over me before one stopped to see if I was a man or dog left in the road?”\n",
            "   “Your job...” she started to say.\n",
            "   “My God, ten years ago we said, in two more years well have enough money to quit and write my novel! But each year weve said next year! and next year and next year!”\n",
            "   “Weve had fun, havent we?”\n",
            "   “Sure! Subways are fun, buses are fun, martinis and drunken friends are fun. Advertising? Yeah! But Ive used all the fun there is! I want to write about what Ive seen now, and theres no better place than this. Look at that house over there! Cant you just see me in the front window banging the hell out of my typewriter?”\n",
            "   “Stop hyperventilating!”\n",
            "   “Hyperventilate? God, Id jump for joy to quit. Ive gone as far as I can go. Come on, Cecelia, lets get back some of the spunk in our marriage, take a chance!”\n",
            "   “The children\n",
            "   “Wed love it here!” said the son.\n",
            "   “I think,” said the daughter.\n",
            "   “Im not getting any younger,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “Nor am I,” she said, touching his arm. “But we cant play hopscotch now. When the children leave, yes, well think about it.”\n",
            "   “Children, hopscotch, my God, Ill take my typewriter to the grave!”\n",
            "   “It wont be long. We—”\n",
            "   The shop door squealed open again and whether the old man had been standing in the screen shadow for the last minute, there was no telling. It did not show in his face. He stepped out with four lukewarm bottles of Orange Crush in his rust-spotted hands.\n",
            "   “Here you are,” he said.\n",
            "   Clarence and Cecelia Travers turned to stare at him as if he were a stranger come out to bring them drinks. They smiled and took the bottles.\n",
            "   The four of them stood drinking the soda pop in the warm sunlight. The summer wind blew through the grottoes of trees in the old, shady town. It was like being in a great green church, a cathedral, the trees so high that the people and cottages were lost far down below. All night long you would imagine those trees rustling Their leaves like an ocean on an unending shore. God, thought Clarence Travers, you could really sleep here, the sleep of the dead and the peace-fill-of-heart.\n",
            "   He finished his drink and his wife half finished hers and gave it to the children to argue over, inch by compared inch. The old man stood silent, embarrassed by the thing he may have stirred up among them.\n",
            "   “Well, if youre ever out this way, drop in,” he said. Clarence Travers reached for his wallet.\n",
            "   “No, no!” said the old man. “Its on the house.”\n",
            "   “Thank you, thank you very much.”\n",
            "   “A pleasure.”\n",
            "   They climbed back into their car.\n",
            "   “If you want to get to the freeway,” said the old man, peering through the front window into the cooked-upholstery smell of the car, “just take your old dirt road back. Dont rush, or youll break an axle.”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers looked straight ahead at the radiator fixture on the car front and started the motor.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” the children yelled, and waved. The car moved away through the town.\n",
            "   “Did you hear what the old man said?” asked the wife.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Did you hear him say which way to the freeway?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   He drove through the cool, shady town, staring at the porches and the windows with the colored glass fringing them. If you looked from the inside of those windows out, people had different-colored faces for each pane you looked through. They were Chinese if you looked through one, Indian through another, pink, green, violet, burgundy, wine, chartreuse, the candy colors, the lemon-lime cool colors, the water colors of the windows looking out on lawns and trees and this car slowly driving past.\n",
            "   “Yes, I heard him,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   They left the town behind and took the dirt road to the freeway. They waited their chance, saw an interval between floods of cars hurtling by, swerved out into the stream, and, at fifty miles an hour, were soon hurtling toward the city.\n",
            "   “Thats better,” said Cecelia Travers brightly. She did not look over at her husband. “Now I know where we are.”\n",
            "   Billboards flashed by; a mortuary, a pie crust, a cereal, a garage, a hotel. A hotel in the tar pits of the city, where one day is the pitiless glare of the noon sun, thought Mr. Travers, all of the great Erector-set buildings, like prehistoric dinosaurs, will sink down into the bubbling tar-lava and be encased, bone by bone, for future civilizations. And in the stomachs of the electric lizards, inside the iron dinosaurs, the probing scientists of A. D. One Million will find the little ivory bones, the thinly articulated skeletons of advertising executives and clubwomen and children. Mr. Travers felt his eyes flinch, watering. And the scientists will say, so this is what the iron cities fed on, is it? and give the bones a kick. So this is what kept the iron stomachs full, eh? Poor things, they never had a chance. Probably kept by the iron monsters who needed them in order to survive, who needed them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Aphids, in a way, aphids, kept in a great metal cage.\n",
            "   “Look, Daddy, look, look, before its too late!”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   The old highway, two hundred yards away, at their left, sprang back into sight for an instant, wandered aimlessly through field, meadow, and stream, gentle and cool and quiet.\n",
            "   Mr. Travers swung his head sharply to see, but in that instant it was gone. Billboards, trees, hills rushed it away. A thousand cars, honking, shrieking, shouldered them, and bore Clarence and Cecelia Travers and their captive children stunned and silent down the concourse, onward ever onward into a city that had not seen them leave and did not look to see them return\n",

            "   When I was eight years old, in 1928, an incredible event occurred on the back wall outside the Academy motion picture theater in Waukegan, Illinois. An advertising broadside, some thirty feet long and twenty feet high, dramatized Black-stone the Magician in half a dozen miraculous poses: sawing a lady in half; tied to an Arabian cannon that exploded, taking him with it; dancing a live handkerchief in midair; causing a birdcage with a live canary to vanish between his fingers; causing an elephant to... well, you get the idea. I must have stood there for hours, frozen with awe. I knew then that someday I must become a magician.\n",
            "   Thats what happened, didnt it? Im not a science fiction, fantasy, magic-realism writer of fairy tales and surrealist poems. Quicker Than the Eye may well be the best title I have ever conjured for a new collection. I pretend to do one thing, cause you to blink, and in the instant seize twenty bright silks out of a bottomless hat.\n",
            "   How does he do that? may well be asked. I really cant say. I dont write these stories, they write me. Which causes me to live with a boundless enthusiasm for writing and life that some misinterpret as optimism.\n",
            "   Nonsense. I am merely a practitioner of optimal behavior, which means behave yourself; listen to your Muses, get your work done, and enjoy the sense that you just might live forever.\n",
            "   I dont have to wait for inspiration. It jolts me every morning. Just before dawn, when I would prefer to sleep in, the damned stuff speaks between my ears with my Theater of Morning voices. Yes, yes, I know, that sounds awfully artsy, and no, no, I am not preaching some sort of Psychic Summons. The voices exist because I stashed them there every day for a lifetime by reading, writing, and living. They accumulated and began to speak soon after high school.\n",
            "   In other words, I do not greet each day with a glad cry but am forced out of bed by these whispering nags, drag myself to the typewriter, and am soon awake and alive as the notion/fancy/concept quits my ears, runs down my elbows and out my fingers. Two hours later, a new story is done that, all night, hid asleep behind my medulla oblongata.\n",
            "   That, dont you agree, is not optimism. Its behavior. Optimal.\n",
            "   I dare not oppose these morning voices. If I did, they would ransack my conscience all day. Besides, I am as out of control as a car off a cliff. What began as a numbed frenzy before breakfast, ends with elation at noon lunch.\n",
            "   How did I find these metaphors? Let me count the ways:\n",
            "   You discover your wife is pregnant with your first child soon to be born, so you name the embryonic presence “Sascha” and converse with this increasingly bright fetus that evolves into a story that you love but no one wants. So here it is.\n",
            "   You wonder whatever happened to Dorian Grays portrait. Your second thoughts grow to an outsize horror by nightfall. You upchuck this hairball into your typewriter.\n",
            "   Some of these stories “happened” to me. “Quicker Than the Eye” was part of a magic show I attended where, with dismay, I saw someone much like myself being made a fool of onstage.\n",
            "   “No News, or What Killed the Dog?” was a Victrola record I played all day every day when I was five, until the neighbors offered to break me or the record, choose.\n",
            "   “That Woman on the Lawn” was first a poem that then turned into a story about my mother as a young and needful woman; a topic we care to discuss only with euphemisms.\n",
            "   “Another Fine Mess” resulted from my writing “The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair.” There had to be a sequel, because when I arrived in Ireland forty years ago, the Irish Times announced LAUREL AND HARDY, ONE TIME ONLY, IN PERSON! FOR THE IRISH ORPHANS. OLYMPIA THEATER, DUBLIN. I rushed to the theater and bought the last ticket, front row center!\n",
            "   The curtain rose and there they were, Stan and Ollie, doing all their old, sweet, wondrous routines. I sat with happy tears streaming down my face. Later I went backstage and stood by their dressing room door watching them greet friends. I didnt introduce myself. I just wanted to warm my hands and heart. After twenty minutes of ambience bathing, I slipped away. Thus “Another Fine Mess.”\n",
            "   “Unterderseaboat Doktor” is an example of people not hearing themselves talk. A writer friend at lunch some years back described his psychiatrist, a former submarine captain in Hitlers undersea fleet. “Holy God,” I cried, “give me a pencil!” I scribbled a title and finished the tale that night. My writer friend hated me for weeks.\n",
            "   “Last Rites” wrote itself because I am the greatest lover of other writers, old or new, who ever lived. I have never been jealous of any writer, I only wanted to write and dream like them. That makes for an enormous list, some of them first-class ladies as well as writers first class: Willa Cather, Jessamyn West, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Weelty, and, long before her current fame, Edith Wharton. “Last Rites” shuttles in Time to pay my respects to three of my heroes, Poe, Melville, and a third writer, nameless until the finale. It crazed me to perceive that these giants died thinking they were to be buried unknown and unread. I had to invent a Time Machine to celebrate them on their deathbeds.\n",
            "   Some of the stories are self-evident. “At the End of the Ninth Year” is the sort of quasi-scientific factoid we all discuss a dozen times, but neglect to write.\n",
            "   “The Other Highway” lies beside the main route heading north from Los Angeles. It has all but vanished under grass, bushes, trees, and avalanched soil. Here and there you can still bike it for some few hundred yards before it melts into the earth.\n",
            "   “Once More, Legato” spontaneously combusted one afternoon when I heard a treeful of birds orchestrating Berlioz and then Albeniz.\n",
            "   If you know the history of Paris during the 1870s” Commune and Haussmann, who tore it down and built it back to the wonder it is now, and if you have experienced some Los Angeles earthquakes, you” could guess the genesis of “Zaharoff/Richter Mark V.” During the last High Shake, two years ago, I thought: My God, the damn fools built the city on the San Andreas Fault! My next thought: what if they built it that way on purpose?!\n",
            "   Two hours later, the story was cooling on the windowsill.\n",
            "   Thats not all, but it should do.\n",
            "   My final advice to myself; the boy magician grown old, and you?\n",
            "   When your dawn theater sounds to clear your sinuses:\n",
            "   dont delay. Jump. Those voices may be gone before you hit the shower to align your wits.\n",
            "   Speed is everything. The 90-mph dash to your machine is a sure cure for life rampant and death most real.\n",
            "   Make haste to live.\n",
            "   Oh, God, yes.\n",
            "   Live. And write. With great haste.\n",

            "   IT was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.\n",
            "   Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame.\n",
            "   He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered.\n",
            "   He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.\n",
            "   He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.\n",
            "   Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.\n",
            "   The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment before his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a persons standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.\n",
            "   But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper. Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there, waiting?\n",
            "   He turned the corner.\n",
            "   The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting.\n",
            "   The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive, that he felt he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenix-disc on his chest, he spoke again.\n",
            "   “Of course,” he said, “youre a new neighbour, arent you?”\n",
            "   “And you must be”—she raised her eyes from his professional symbols—“the fireman.” Her voice trailed off.\n",
            "   “How oddly you say that.”\n",
            "   “Id-Id have known it with my eyes shut,” she said, slowly.\n",
            "   “What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains,” he laughed. “You never wash it off completely.”\n",
            "   “No, you dont,” she said, in awe.\n",
            "   He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once moving herself.\n",
            "   “Kerosene,” he said, because the silence had lengthened, “is nothing but perfume to me.”\n",
            "   “Does it seem like that, really?”\n",
            "   “Of course. Why not?”\n",
            "   She gave herself time to think of it. “I dont know.” She turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes. “Do you mind if I walk back with you? Im Clarisse McClellan.”\n",
            "   “Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?”\n",
            "   They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the year.\n",
            "   There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.\n",
            "   “Well,” she said, “Im seventeen and Im crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isnt this a nice time of night to walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night, walking, and watch the sun rise.”\n",
            "   They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, “You know, Im not afraid of you at all.”\n",
            "   He was surprised. “Why should you be?”\n",
            "   “So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But youre just a man, after all...”\n",
            "   He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon...\n",
            "   And then Clarisse McClellan said:\n",
            "   “Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked at being a fireman?”\n",
            "   “Since I was twenty, ten years ago.”\n",
            "   “Do you ever read any of the books you bum?”\n",
            "   He laughed. “Thats against the law!”\n",
            "   “Oh. Of course.”\n",
            "   “Its fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn ‘em to ashes, then bum the ashes. Thats our official slogan.”\n",
            "   They walked still further and the girl said, “Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?”\n",
            "   “No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it.”\n",
            "   “Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.”\n",
            "   He laughed.\n",
            "   She glanced quickly over. “Why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” He started to laugh again and stopped “Why?”\n",
            "   “You laugh when I havent been funny and you answer right off. You never stop to think what Ive asked you.”\n",
            "   He stopped walking, “You are an odd one,” he said, looking at her. “Havent you any respect?”\n",
            "   “I dont mean to be insulting. Its just, I love to watch people too much, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Well, doesnt this mean anything to you?” He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-coloured sleeve.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she whispered. She increased her pace. “Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?\n",
            "   “Youre changing the subject!”\n",
            "   “I sometimes think drivers dont know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,” she said. “If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! hed say, thats grass! A pink blur? Thats a rose-garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isnt that funny, and sad, too?”\n",
            "   “You think too many things,” said Montag, uneasily.\n",
            "   “I rarely watch the ‘parlour walls’ or go to races or Fun Parks. So Ive lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.”\n",
            "   “I didnt know that!” Montag laughed abruptly.\n",
            "   “Bet I know something else you dont. Theres dew on the grass in the morning.”\n",
            "   He suddenly couldnt remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite irritable.\n",
            "   “And if you look”—she nodded at the sky—“theres a man in the moon.”\n",
            "   He hadnt looked for a long time.\n",
            "   They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were blazing.\n",
            "   “Whats going on?” Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.\n",
            "   “Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Its like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another time-did I tell you?-for being a pedestrian. Oh, were most peculiar.”\n",
            "   “But what do you talk about?”\n",
            "   She laughed at this. “Good night!” She started up her walk. Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. “Are you happy?” she said.\n",
            "   “Am I what?” he cried.\n",
            "   But she was gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently.\n",
            "   “Happy! Of all the nonsense.”\n",
            "   He stopped laughing.\n",
            "   He put his hand into the glove-hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door slid open.\n",
            "   Of course Im happy. What does she think? Im not? he asked the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes quickly away.\n",
            "   What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked...\n",
            "   Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girls face was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but moving also toward a new sun.\n",
            "   “What?” asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience.\n",
            "   He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your own light to you? People were more often-he searched for a simile, found one in his work-torches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other peoples faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?\n",
            "   What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes? Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would.\n",
            "   Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night...\n",
            "   He opened the bedroom door.\n",
            "   It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not empty.\n",
            "   He listened.\n",
            "   The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.\n",
            "   He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\n",
            "   Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.\n",
            "   The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the curtains and open the french windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling of a man who will die in the  hour for lack of air,. he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed.\n",
            "   An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.\n",
            "   He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night. The breath coming out of the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fibre of hair.\n",
            "   He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick...\n",
            "   Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall; but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out of her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.\n",
            "   The object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under the edge of his own bed. The small crystal bottle of sleeping-tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare.\n",
            "   As he stood there the sky over the house screamed. There was a tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand miles of black linen down the seam. Montag was cut in half. He felt his chest chopped down and split apart. The jet-bombs going over, going over, going over, one two, one two, one two, six of them, nine of them, twelve of them, one and one and one and another and another and another, did all the screaming for him. He opened his own mouth and let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth. The house shook. The flare went out in his hand. The moonstones vanished. He felt his hand plunge toward the telephone.\n",
            "   The jets were gone. He felt his lips move, brushing the mouthpiece of the phone. “Emergency hospital.” A terrible whisper.\n",
            "   He felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be thought as he stood shivering in the dark, and let his lips go on moving and moving.\n",
            "   They had this machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil. Did it drink of the darkness? Did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the years? It fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation and blind searching. It had an Eye. The impersonal operator of the machine could, by wearing a special optical helmet, gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out. What did the Eye see? He did not say. He saw but did not see what the Eye saw. The entire operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in ones yard. The woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they had reached. Go on, anyway, shove the bore down, slush up the emptiness, if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the suction snake. The operator stood smoking a cigarette. The other machine was working too.\n",
            "   The other machine was operated by an equally impersonal fellow in non-stainable reddish-brown overalls. This machine pumped all of the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum.\n",
            "   “Got to clean ‘em out both ways,” said the operator, standing over the silent woman. “No use getting the stomach if you dont clean the blood. Leave that stuff in the blood and the blood hits the brain like a mallet, bang, a couple of thousand times and the brain just gives up, just quits.”\n",
            "   “Stop it!” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I was just sayin,” said the operator.\n",
            "   “Are you done?” said Montag.\n",
            "   They shut the machines up tight. “Were done.” His anger did not even touch them. They stood with the cigarette smoke curling around their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint. “Thats fifty bucks.”\n",
            "   “First, why dont you tell me if shell be all right?”\n",
            "   “Sure, shell be O. K. We got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase here, it cant get at her now. As I said, you take out the old and put in the new and youre O. K.”\n",
            "   “Neither of you is an M. D. Why didnt they send an M. D. from Emergency?”\n",
            "   “Hell!” the operators cigarette moved on his lips. “We get these cases nine or ten a night. Got so many, starting a few years ago, we had the special machines built. With the optical lens, of course, that was new; the rest is ancient. You dont need an M. D., case like this; all you need is two handymen, clean up the problem in half an hour. Look”—he started for the door—“we gotta go. Just had another call on the old ear-thimble. Ten blocks from here. Someone else just jumped off the cap of a pillbox. Call if you need us again. Keep her quiet. We got a contra-sedative in her. Shell wake up hungry. So long.”\n",
            "   And the men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths, the men with the eyes of puff-adders, took up their load of machine and tube, their case of liquid melancholy and the slow dark sludge of nameless stuff, and strolled out the door.\n",
            "   Montag sank down into a chair and looked at this woman. Her eyes were closed now, gently, and he put out his hand to feel the warmness of breath on his palm.\n",
            "   “Mildred,” he said, at last.\n",
            "   There are too many of us, he thought. There are billions of us and thats too many. Nobody knows anyone. Strangers come and violate you. Strangers come and cut your heart out. Strangers come and take your blood. Good God, who were those men? I never saw them before in my life!\n",
            "   Half an hour passed.\n",
            "   The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of colour and they looked soft and relaxed. Someone elses blood there. If only someone elses flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaners and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning. If only...\n",
            "   He got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows wide to let the night air in. It was two oclock in the morning. Was it only an hour ago, Clarisse McClellan in the street, and him coming in, and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle? Only an hour, but the world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colourless form.\n",
            "   Laughter blew across the moon-coloured lawn from the house of Clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly. Above all, their laughter was relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in darkness. Montag heard the voices talking, talking, talking, giving, talking, weaving, reweaving their hypnotic web.\n",
            "   Montag moved out through the french windows and crossed the lawn, without even thinking of it. He stood outside the talking house in the shadows, thinking he might even tap on their door and whisper, “Let me come in. I wont say anything. I just want to listen. What is it youre saying?”\n",
            "   But instead he stood there, very cold, his face a mask of ice, listening to a mans voice (the uncle?) moving along at an easy pace:\n",
            "   “Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow, wad, flush. Everyone using everyone elses coattails. How are you supposed to root for the home team when you dont even have a programme or know the names? For that matter, what colour jerseys are they wearing as they trot out on to the field?”\n",
            "   Montag moved back to his own house, left the window wide, checked Mildred, tucked the covers about her carefully, and then lay down with the moonlight on his cheek-bones and on the frowning ridges in his brow, with the moonlight distilled in each eye to form a silver cataract there.\n",
            "   One drop of rain. Clarisse. Another drop. Mildred. A third. The uncle. A fourth. The fire tonight. One, Clarisse. Two, Mildred. Three, uncle. Four, fire, One, Mildred, two, Clarisse. One, two, three, four, five, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, sleeping-tablets, men, disposable tissue, coat-tails, blow, wad, flush, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, tablets, tissues, blow, wad, flush. One, two, three, one, two, three! Rain. The storm. The uncle laughing. Thunder falling downstairs. The whole world pouring down. The fire gushing up in a volcano. All rushing on down around in a spouting roar and rivering stream toward morning.\n",
            "   “I dont know anything any more,” he said, and let a sleep-lozenge dissolve on his tongue.\n",
            "   At nine in the morning, Mildreds bed was empty.\n",
            "   Montag got up quickly, his heart pumping, and ran down the hall and stopped at the kitchen door.\n",
            "   Toast popped out of the silver toaster, was seized by a spidery metal hand that drenched it with melted butter.\n",
            "   Mildred watched the toast delivered to her plate. She had both ears plugged with electronic bees that were humming the hour away. She looked up suddenly, saw him, and nodded.\n",
            "   “You all right?” he asked.\n",
            "   She was an expert at lip-reading from ten years of apprenticeship at Seashell ear-thimbles. She nodded again. She set the toaster clicking away at another piece of bread.\n",
            "   Montag sat down.\n",
            "   His wife said, “I dont know why I should be so hungry.”\n",
            "   “You-?”\n",
            "   “Im HUNGRY.”\n",
            "   “Last night,” he began.\n",
            "   “Didnt sleep well. Feel terrible,” she said. “God, Im hungry. I cant figure it.”\n",
            "   “Last night-” he said again.\n",
            "   She watched his lips casually. “What about last night?”\n",
            "   “Dont you remember?”\n",
            "   “What? Did we have a wild party or something? Feel like Ive a hangover. God, Im hungry. Who was here?”\n",
            "   “A few people,” he said.\n",
            "   “Thats what I thought.” She chewed her toast. “Sore stomach, but Im hungry as all-get-out. Hope I didnt do anything foolish at the party.”\n",
            "   “No,” he said, quietly.\n",
            "   The toaster spidered out a piece of buttered bread for him. He held it in his hand, feeling grateful.\n",
            "   “You dont look so hot yourself,” said his wife.\n",
            "   In the late afternoon it rained and the entire world was dark grey. He stood in the hall of his house, putting on his badge with the orange salamander burning across it. He stood looking up at the air-conditioning vent in the hall for a long time. His wife in the TV parlour paused long enough from reading her script to glance up. “Hey,” she said. “The mans THINKING!”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “I wanted to talk to you.” He paused. “You took all the pills in your bottle last night.”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wouldnt do that,” she said, surprised.\n",
            "   “The bottle was empty.”\n",
            "   “I wouldnt do a thing like that. Why would I do a thing like that?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Maybe you took two pills and forgot and took two more, and forgot again and took two more, and were so dopy you kept right on until you had thirty or forty of them in you.”\n",
            "   “Heck,” she said, “what would I want to go and do a silly thing like that for?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” he said.\n",
            "   She was quite obviously waiting for him to go. “I didnt do that,” she said. “Never in a billion years.”\n",
            "   “All right if you say so,” he said.\n",
            "   “Thats what the lady said.” She turned back to her script.\n",
            "   “Whats on this afternoon?” he asked tiredly.\n",
            "   She didnt look up from her script again. “Well, this is a play comes on the wall-to-wall circuit in ten minutes. They mailed me my part this morning. I sent in some box-tops. They write the script with one part missing. Its a new idea. The home-maker, thats me, is the missing part. When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, ‘What do you think of this whole idea, Helen?’ And he looks at me sitting here centre stage, see? And I say, I say—” She paused and ran her finger under a line in the script. ‘I think thats fine!’ And then they go on with the play until he says, ‘Do you agree to that, Helen!’ and I say, ‘I sure do!’ Isnt that fun, Guy?”\n",
            "   He stood in the hall looking at her.\n",
            "   “Its sure fun,” she said.\n",
            "   “Whats the play about?”\n",
            "   “I just told you. There are these people named Bob and Ruth and Helen.”\n",
            "   “Oh.”\n",
            "   “Its really fun. Itll be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? Its only two thousand dollars.”\n",
            "   “Thats one-third of my yearly pay.”\n",
            "   “Its only two thousand dollars,” she replied. “And I should think youd consider me sometimes. If we had a fourth wall, why itd be just like this room wasnt ours at all, but all kinds of exotic peoples rooms. We could do without a few things.”\n",
            "   “Were already doing without a few things to pay for the third wall. It was put in only two months ago, remember?”\n",
            "   “Is that all it was?” She sat looking at him for a long moment. “Well, good-bye, dear.”\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” he said. He stopped and turned around. “Does it have a happy ending?”\n",
            "   “I havent read that far.”\n",
            "   He walked over, read the last page, nodded, folded the script, and handed it back to her. He walked out of the house into the rain.\n",
            "   The rain was thinning away and the girl was walking in the centre of the sidewalk with her head up and the few drops falling on her face. She smiled when she saw Montag.\n",
            "   “Hello!”\n",
            "   He said hello and then said, “What are you up to now?”\n",
            "   “Im still crazy. The rain feels good. I love to walk in it.\n",
            "   “I dont think Id like that,” he said.\n",
            "   “You might if you tried.”\n",
            "   “I never have.”\n",
            "   She licked her lips. “Rain even tastes good.”\n",
            "   “What do you do, go around trying everything once?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Sometimes twice.” She looked at something in her hand.\n",
            "   “Whatve you got there?” he said.\n",
            "   “I guess its the last of the dandelions this year. I didnt think Id find one on the lawn this late. Have you ever heard of rubbing it under your chin? Look.” She touched her chin with the flower, laughing.\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “If it rubs off, it means Im in love. Has it?”\n",
            "   He could hardly do anything else but look.\n",
            "   “Well?” she said.\n",
            "   “Youre yellow under there.”\n",
            "   “Fine! Lets try YOU now.”\n",
            "   “It wont work for me.”\n",
            "   “Here.” Before he could move she had put the dandelion under his chin. He drew back and she laughed. “Hold still!”\n",
            "   She peered under his chin and frowned.\n",
            "   “Well?” he said.\n",
            "   “What a shame,” she said. “Youre not in love with anyone.”\n",
            "   “Yes, I am!”\n",
            "   “It doesnt show.”\n",
            "   “I am very much in love!” He tried to conjure up a face to fit the words, but there was no face. “I am!”\n",
            "   “Oh please dont look that way.”\n",
            "   “Its that dandelion,” he said. “Youve used it all up on yourself. Thats why it wont work for me.”\n",
            "   “Of course, that must be it. Oh, now Ive upset you, I can see I have; Im sorry, really I am.” She touched his elbow.\n",
            "   “No, no,” he said, quickly, “Im all right.”\n",
            "   “Ive got to be going, so say you forgive me. I dont want you angry with me.”\n",
            "   “Im not angry. Upset, yes.”\n",
            "   “Ive got to go to see my psychiatrist now. They make me go. I made up things to say. I dont know what he thinks of me. He says Im a regular onion! I keep him busy peeling away the layers.”\n",
            "   “Im inclined to believe you need the psychiatrist,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “You dont mean that.”\n",
            "   He took a breath and let it out and at last said, “No, I dont mean that.”\n",

            "   “They want to know what I do with all my time. I tell them that sometimes I just sit and think. But I wont tell them what. Ive got them running. And sometimes, I tell them, I like to put my head back, like this, and let the rain fall into my mouth. It tastes just like wine. Have you ever tried it?”\n",
            "   “No I—”\n",
            "   “You HAVE forgiven me, havent you?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” He thought about it. “Yes, I have. God knows why. Youre peculiar, youre aggravating, yet youre easy to forgive. You say youre seventeen?”\n",
            "   “Well- month.”\n",
            "   “How odd. How strange. And my wife thirty and yet you seem so much older at times. I cant get over it.”\n",
            "   “Youre peculiar yourself, Mr. Montag. Sometimes I even forget youre a fireman. Now, may I make you angry again?”\n",
            "   “Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “How did it start? How did you get into it? How did you pick your work and how did you happen to think to take the job you have? Youre not like the others. Ive seen a few; I know. When I talk, you look at me. When I said something about the moon, you looked at the moon, last night. The others would never do that. The others would walk off and leave me talking. Or threaten me. No one has time any more for anyone else. Youre one of the few who put up with me. Thats why I think its so strange youre a fireman, it just doesnt seem right for you, somehow.”\n",
            "   He felt his body divide itself into a hotness and a coldness, a softness and a hardness, a trembling and a not trembling, the two halves grinding one upon the other.\n",
            "   “Youd better run on to your appointment,” he said.\n",
            "   And she ran off and left him standing there in the rain. Only after a long time did he move.\n",
            "   And then, very slowly, as he walked, he tilted his head back in the rain, for just a few moments, and opened his mouth...\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live in its gently humming, gently vibrating, softly illuminated kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse. The dim light of one in the morning, the moonlight from the open sky framed through the great window, touched here and there on the brass and the copper and the steel of the faintly trembling beast. Light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently, gently, gently, its eight legs spidered under it on rubber-padded paws.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the brass pole. He went out to look at the city and the clouds had cleared away completely, and he lit a cigarette and came back to bend down and look at the Hound. It was like a great bee come home from some field where the honey is full of poison wildness, of insanity and nightmare, its body crammed with that over-rich nectar and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself.\n",
            "   “Hello,” whispered Montag, fascinated as always with the dead beast, the living beast.\n",
            "   At night when things got dull, which was every night, the men slid down the brass poles, and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory system of the Hound and let loose rats in the firehouse area-way, and sometimes chickens, and sometimes cats that would have to be drowned anyway, and there would be betting to see which the Hound would seize first. The animals were turned loose. Three seconds later the game was done, the rat, cat, or chicken caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentling paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the Hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine. The pawn was then tossed in the incinerator. A new game began.\n",
            "   Montag stayed upstairs most nights when this went on. There had been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them, and lost a weeks salary and faced Mildreds insane anger, which showed itself in veins and blotches. But now at night he lay in his bunk, face turned to the wall, listening to whoops of laughter below and the piano-string scurry of rat feet, the violin squeaking of mice, and the great shadowing, motioned silence of the Hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light, finding, holding its victim, inserting the needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a switch had been turned.\n",
            "   Montag touched the muzzle..\n",
            "   The Hound growled.\n",
            "   Montag jumped back.\n",
            "   The Hound half rose in its kennel and looked at him with green-blue neon light flickering in its suddenly activated eyebulbs. It growled again, a strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle, a frying sound, a scraping of metal, a turning of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion.\n",
            "   “No, no, boy,” said Montag, his heart pounding.\n",
            "   He saw the silver needle extended upon the air an inch, pull back, extend, pull back. The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him.\n",
            "   Montag backed up. The Hound took a step from its kennel.\n",
            "   Montag grabbed the brass pole with one hand. The pole, reacting, slid upward, and took him through the ceiling, quietly. He stepped off in the half-lit deck of the upper level. He was trembling and his face was green-white. Below, the Hound had sunk back down upon its eight incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again, its multi-faceted eyes at peace.\n",
            "   Montag stood, letting the fears pass, by the drop-hole. Behind him, four men at a card table under a green-lidded light in the corner glanced briefly but said nothing. Only the man with the Captains hat and the sign of the Phoenix on his hat, at last, curious, his playing cards in his thin hand, talked across the long room.\n",
            "   “Montag...?”\n",
            "   “It doesnt like me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What, the Hound?” The Captain studied his cards.\n",
            "   “Come off it. It doesnt like or dislike. It just ‘functions.’ Its like a lesson in ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide for it. It follows through. It targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. Its only copper wire, storage batteries, and electricity.”\n",
            "   Montag swallowed. “Its calculators can be set to any combination, so many amino acids, so much sulphur, so much butterfat and alkaline. Right?”\n",

            "   “It doesnt think anything we dont want it to think.”\n",
            "   “Thats sad,” said Montag, quietly, “because all we put into it is hunting and finding and killing. What a shame if thats all it can ever know.”\n",

Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumb-tacked to his door. Every day Clarisse walked him to the corner. One day it was raining, the  it was clear, the day after that the wind blew strong, and the day after that it was mild and calm, and the day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer and Clarisse with her face all sunburnt by late afternoon.\n",

Social to me means talking about things like this.” She rattled some chestnuts that had fallen off the tree in the front yard. “Or talking about how strange the world is. Being with people is nice. But I dont think its social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most dont; they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film-teacher. Thats not social to me at all. Its a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and them telling us its wine when its not. They run us so ragged by the end of the day we cant do anything but go to bed or head for a Fun Park to bully people around, break windowpanes in the Window Smasher place or wreck cars in the Car Wrecker place with the big steel ball. Or go out in the cars and race on the streets, trying to see how close you can get to lamp-posts, playing ‘chicken’ and ‘knock hub-caps.’ I guess Im everything they say I am, all right. I havent any friends. Thats supposed to prove Im abnormal. But everyone I know is either shouting or dancing around like wild or beating up one another.

Six of my friends have been shot in the last year alone. Ten of them died in car wrecks. Im afraid of them and they dont like me because Im afraid. My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children didnt kill each other. But that was a long time ago when they had things different. They believed in responsibility, my uncle says.

Sometimes I even go to the Fun Parks and ride in the jet cars when they race on the edge of town at midnight and the police dont care as long as theyre insured.

The lawn was empty, the trees empty, the street empty, and while at first he did not even know he missed her or was even looking for her, the fact was that by the time he reached the subway, there were vague stirrings of un-ease in him. Something was the matter, his routine had been disturbed. A simple routine, true, established in a short few days, and yet...? He almost turned back to make the walk again, to give her time to appear. He was certain if he tried the same route, everything would work out fine. But it was late, and the arrival of his train put a stop to his plan.\n",
            "   The flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time-voice in the firehouse ceiling “...one thirty-five. Thursday morning, November 4th,... one thirty-six... one thirty-seven a. m...” The tick of the playing-cards on the greasy table-top, all the sounds came to Montag, behind his closed eyes, behind the barrier he had momentarily erected. He could feel the firehouse full of glitter and shine and silence, of brass colours, the colours of coins, of gold, of silver: The unseen men across the table were sighing on their cards, waiting.\n",
            "   “...one forty-five...” The voice-clock mourned out the cold hour of a cold morning of a still colder year.\n",

            "   Montag blinked. Beatty was looking at him as if he were a museum statue. At any moment, Beatty might rise and walk about him, touching, exploring his guilt and self-consciousness. Guilt? What guilt was that?\n",
            "   “Your play, Montag.”\n",
            "   Montag looked at these men whose faces were sunburnt by a thousand real and ten thousand imaginary fires, whose work flushed their cheeks and fevered their eyes. These men who looked steadily into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning black pipes. They and their charcoal hair and soot-coloured brows and bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had shaven close; but their heritage showed. Montag started up, his mouth opened. Had he ever seen a fireman that didnt have black hair, black brows, a fiery face, and a blue-steel shaved but unshaved look? These men were all mirror-images of himself! Were all firemen picked then for their looks as well as their proclivities? The colour of cinders and ash about them, and the continual smell of burning from their pipes. Captain Beatty there, rising in thunderheads of tobacco smoke. Beatty opening a fresh tobacco packet, crumpling the cellophane into a sound of fire.\n",
            "   Montag looked at the cards in his own hands. “I-Ive been thinking. About the fire last week. About the man whose library we fixed. What happened to him?”\n",

            "   “He. wasnt insane.”\n",
            "   Beatty arranged his cards quietly. “Any mans insane who thinks he can fool the Government and us.”\n",
            "   “Ive tried to imagine,” said Montag, “just how it would feel. I mean to have firemen burn our houses and our books.”\n",
            "   “We havent any books.”\n",
            "   “But if we did have some.”\n",
            "   “You got some?”\n",
            "   Beatty blinked slowly.\n",
            "   “No.” Montag gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists of a million forbidden books. Their names leapt in fire, burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene. “No.” But in his mind, a cool wind started up and blew out of the ventilator grille at home, softly, softly, chilling his face. And, again, he saw himself in a green park talking to an old man, a very old man, and the wind from the park was cold, too.\n",
            "   Montag hesitated, “Was-was it always like this? The firehouse, our work? I mean, well, once upon a time...”\n",
            "   “Once upon a time!” Beatty said. “What kind of talk is THAT?”\n",
            "   Fool, thought Montag to himself, youll give it away. At the last fire, a book of fairy tales, hed glanced at a single line. “I mean,” he said, “in the old days, before homes were completely fireproofed” Suddenly it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him. He opened his mouth and it was Clarisse McClellan saying, “Didnt firemen prevent fires rather than stoke them up and get them going?”\n",
            "   “Thats rich!” Stoneman and Black drew forth their rulebooks, which also contained brief histories of the Firemen of America, and laid them out where Montag, though long familiar with them, might read:\n",

            "   RULE 1. Answer the alarm swiftly.\n",

            "   4. Report back to firehouse immediately.\n",
            "   5. Stand alert for other alarms.\n",
            "   Everyone watched Montag. He did not move.\n",
            "   The alarm sounded.\n",
            "   The bell in the ceiling kicked itself two hundred times. Suddenly there were four empty chairs. The cards fell in a flurry of snow. The brass pole shivered. The men were gone.\n",
            "   Montag sat in his chair. Below, the orange dragon coughed into life.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the pole like a man in a dream.\n",

            "   “Montag, you forgot your helmet!”\n",
            "   He seized it off the wall behind him, ran, leapt, and they were off, the night wind hammering about their siren scream and their mighty metal thunder!\n",
            "   It was a flaking three-storey house in the ancient part of the city, a century old if it was a day, but like all houses it had been given a thin fireproof plastic sheath many years ago, and this preservative shell seemed to be the only thing holding it in the sky.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The engine slammed to a stop. Beatty, Stoneman, and Black ran up the sidewalk, suddenly odious and fat in the plump fireproof slickers. Montag followed.\n",
            "   They crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman, though she was not running, she was not trying to escape. She was only standing, weaving from side to side, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head. Her tongue was moving in her mouth, and her eyes seemed to be trying to remember something, and then they remembered and her tongue moved again:\n",

            "   “Enough of that!” said Beatty. “Where are they?”\n",
            "   He slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the question. The old womans eyes came to a focus upon Beatty. “You know where they are or you wouldnt be here,” she said.\n",

            "   Next thing they were up in musty blackness, swinging silver hatchets at doors that were, after all, unlocked, tumbling through like boys all rollick and shout. “Hey!” A fountain of books sprang down upon Montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stair-well. How inconvenient! Always before it had been like snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victims mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You werent hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldnt be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things dont scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene! Whos got a match!\n",
            "   But now, tonight, someone had slipped. This woman was spoiling the ritual. The men were making too much noise, laughing, joking to cover her terrible accusing silence below. She made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor correct. Montag felt an immense irritation. She shouldnt be here, on top of everything!\n",
            "   Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face A book alighted, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim, wavering light, a page hung. open and it was like a snowy feather, the words delicately painted thereon. In all the rush and fervour, Montag had only an instant to read a line, but it blazed in his mind for the  minute as if stamped there with fiery steel. “Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.” He dropped the book. Immediately, another fell into his arms.\n",
            "   “Montag, up here!”\n",
            "   Montags hand closed like a mouth, crushed the book with wild devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air. They fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among the bodies.\n",
            "   Montag had done nothing. His hand had done it all, his hand, with a brain of its own, with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling finger, had turned thief.. Now, it plunged the book back under his arm, pressed it tight to sweating armpit, rushed out empty, with a magicians flourish! Look here! Innocent! Look!\n",
            "   He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were far-sighted. He held it close, as if he were blind.\n",
            "   “Montag!”\n",
            "   He jerked about.\n",
            "   “Dont stand there, idiot!”\n",
            "   The books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone.\n",
            "   “Kerosene! They pumped the cold fluid from the numbered 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book, they pumped rooms full of it.\n",
            "   They hurried downstairs, Montag staggered after them in the kerosene fumes.\n",
            "   “Come on, woman!”\n",
            "   The woman knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag.\n",

            "   “You know the law,” said Beatty. “Wheres your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. Youve been locked up here for years with a regular damned Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now!”\n",
            "   She shook her head.\n",
            "   “The whole house is going up;” said Beatty,\n",
            "   The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at Montag, who stood near the woman.\n",

            "   “Five. Six.”\n",
            "   “You can stop counting,” she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.\n",
            "   An ordinary kitchen match.\n",
            "   The sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house. Captain Beatty, keeping his dignity, backed slowly through the front door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitements. God, thought Montag, how true! Always at night the alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because the fire is prettier by night? More spectacle, a better show? The pink face of Beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door. The womans hand twitched on the single matchstick. The fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. Montag felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said the woman, and Montag felt himself back away and away out of the door, after Beatty, down the steps, across the lawn, where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail.\n",
            "   On the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly with her eyes, her quietness a condemnation, the woman stood motionless.\n",
            "   Beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene.\n",
            "   He was too late. Montag gasped.\n",
            "   The woman on the porch reached out with contempt for them all, and struck the kitchen match against the railing.\n",
            "   People ran out of houses all down the street.\n",
            "   They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse. Nobody looked at anyone else. Montag sat in the front seat with Beatty and Black. They did not even smoke their pipes. They sat there looking out of the front of the great salamander as they turned a corner and went silently on.\n",
            "   “Master Ridley,” said Montag at last.\n",
            "   “What?” said Beatty.\n",
            "   “She said, ‘Master Ridley.’ She said some crazy thing when we came in the door. ‘Play the man,’ she said, ‘Master Ridley.’ Something, something, something.”\n",
            "   “We shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out,” said Beatty. Stoneman glanced over at the Captain, as did Montag, startled.\n",
            "   Beatty rubbed his chin. “A man named Latimer said that to a man named Nicholas Ridley, as they were being burnt alive at Oxford, for heresy, on October 16, 1555.”\n",
            "   Montag and Stoneman went back to looking at the street as it moved under the engine wheels.\n",
            "   “Im full of bits and pieces,” said Beatty. “Most fire captains have to be. Sometimes I surprise myself. WATCH it, Stoneman!”\n",
            "   Stoneman braked the truck.\n",
            "   “Damn!” said Beatty. “Youve gone right by the comer where we turn for the firehouse.”\n",

            "   “Who would it be?” said Montag, leaning back against the closed door in the dark.\n",

            "   He heard her roll impatiently; the bedsprings squealed.\n",

            "   So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders, and then the jump-over from shoulder-blade to shoulder-blade like a spark leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.\n",
            "   His wife said, “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   He balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers.\n",
            "   A minute later she said, “Well, just dont stand there in the middle of the floor.”\n",
            "   He made a small sound.\n",
            "   “What?” she asked.\n",
            "   He made more soft sounds. He stumbled towards the bed and shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow. He fell into bed and his wife cried out, startled. He lay far across the room from her, on a winter island separated by an empty sea. She talked to him for what seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about that and it was only words, like the words he had heard once in a nursery at a friends house, a two-year-old child building word patterns, talking jargon, making pretty sounds in the air. But Montag said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small sounds, he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek. He knew that when she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet.\n",
            "   Late in the night he looked over at Mildred. She was awake. There was a tiny dance of melody in the air, her Seashell was tamped in her ear again and she was listening to far people in far places, her eyes wide and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling.\n",
            "   Wasnt there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and telephoned her to ask what was for dinner? Well, then, why didnt he buy himself an audio-Seashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife late at night, murmur, whisper, shout, scream, yell? But what would he whisper, what would he yell? What could he say?\n",
            "   And suddenly she was so strange he couldnt believe he knew her at all. He was in someone elses house, like those other jokes people told of the gentleman, drunk, coming home late at night, unlocking the wrong door, entering a wrong room, and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work and neither of them the wiser.\n",
            "   “Millie...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “I didnt mean to startle you. What I want to know is...”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet. And where?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet for what?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I mean-originally.”\n",
            "   He knew she must be frowning in the dark.\n",
            "   He clarified it. “The first time we ever met, where was it, and when?”\n",
            "   “Why, it was at—”\n",
            "   She stopped.\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said.\n",
            "   He was cold. “Cant you remember?”\n",
            "   “Its been so long.”\n",
            "   “Only ten years, thats all, only ten!”\n",
            "   “Dont get excited, Im trying to think.” She laughed an odd little laugh that went up and up. “Funny, how funny, not to remember where or when you met your husband or wife.”\n",
            "   He lay massaging his eyes, his brow, and the back of his neck, slowly. He held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure there as if to crush memory into place. It was suddenly more important than any other thing in a life-time that he knew where he had met Mildred.\n",
            "   “It doesnt matter,” She was up in the bathroom now, and he heard the water running, and the swallowing sound she made.\n",
            "   “No, I guess not,” he said.\n",
            "   He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc-oxide-faced men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths and the electronic-eyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water, and he wanted to call out to her, how many have you taken TONIGHT! the capsules! how many will you take later and not know? and so on, every hour! or maybe not tonight, tomorrow night! And me not sleeping, tonight or tomorrow night or any night for a long while; now that this has started. And he thought of her lying on the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her, not bent with concern, but only standing straight, arms folded. And he remembered thinking then that if she died, he was certain he wouldnt cry. For it would be the dying of an unknown, a street face, a newspaper image, and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had begun to cry, not at death but at the thought of not crying at death, a silly empty man near a silly empty woman, while the hungry snake made her still more empty.\n",
            "   How do you get so empty? he wondered. Who takes it out of you? And that awful flower the other day, the dandelion! It had summed up everything, hadnt it? “What a shame! Youre not in love with anyone!” And why not?\n",
            "   Well, wasnt there a wall between him and Mildred, when you came down to it? Literally not just one, wall but, so far, three! And expensive, too! And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls, the gibbering pack of tree-apes that said nothing, nothing, nothing and said it loud, loud, loud. He had taken to calling them relatives from the very first. “Hows Uncle Louis today?” “Who?” “And Aunt Maude?” The most significant memory he had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees (you could feel the memory of their shapes all about) sitting in the centre of the “living-room.” The living-room; what a good job of labelling that was now. No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to Mildred.\n",
            "   “Something must be done!I”\n",
            "   “Yes, something must be done!”\n",
            "   “Well, lets not stand and talk!”\n",
            "   “Lets do it!”\n",
            "   “Im so mad I could SPIT!”\n",
            "   What was it all about? Mildred couldnt say. Who was mad at whom? Mildred didnt quite know. What were they going to do? Well, said Mildred, wait around and see.\n",
            "   He had waited around to see.\n",
            "   A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-never-never-quite-no not quite-touched-bottom...and you fell so fast you didnt touch the sides either...never...quite... touched. anything.\n",
            "   The thunder faded. The music died.\n",
            "   “There,” said Mildred,\n",
            "   And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again:\n",
            "   “Well, everything will be all right now,” said an “aunt.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont be too sure,” said a “cousin.”\n",
            "   “Now, dont get angry!”\n",
            "   “Whos angry?”\n",
            "   “YOU are!”\n",
            "   “Youre mad!”\n",
            "   “Why should I be mad!”\n",
            "   “Because!”\n",
            "   “Thats all very well,” cried Montag, “but what are they mad about? Who are these people? Whos that man and whos that woman? Are they husband and wife, are they divorced, engaged, what? Good God, nothings connected up.”\n",
            "   “They—” said Mildred. “Well, they-they had this fight, you see. They certainly fight a lot. You should listen. I think theyre married. Yes, theyre married. Why?”\n",
            "   And if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the dream complete, then it was the open car and Mildred driving a hundred miles an hour across town, he shouting at her and she shouting back and both trying to hear what was said, but hearing only the scream of the car. “At least keep it down to the minimum!” he yelled: “What?” she cried. “Keep it down to fifty-five, the minimum!” he shouted. “The what?” she shrieked. “Speed!” he shouted. And she pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath from his mouth.\n",
            "   When they stepped out of the car, she had the Seashells stuffed in her ears.\n",
            "   Silence. Onlv the wind blowing softlv.\n",
            "   “Mildred.” He stirred in bed.\n",
            "   He reached over and pulled one of the tiny musical insects out of her ear. “Mildred. Mildred?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” Her voice was faint.\n",
            "   He felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between the slots of the phono-colour walls, speaking, but the speech not piercing the crystal barrier. He could only pantomime, hoping she would turn his way and see him. They could not touch through the glass.\n",
            "   “Mildred, do you know that girl I was telling you about?”\n",
            "   “What girl?” She was almost asleep.\n",
            "   “The girl  door.”\n",
            "   “What girl  door?”\n",
            "   “You know, the high-school girl. Clarisse, her name is.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “I havent seen her for a few days-four days to be exact. Have you seen her?”\n",
            "   “No.”\n",
            "   “Ive meant to talk to you about her. Strange.”\n",
            "   “Oh, I know the one you mean.”\n",
            "   “I thought you would.”\n",
            "   “Her,” said Mildred in the dark room.\n",
            "   “What about her?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “I meant to tell you. Forgot. Forgot.”\n",
            "   “Tell me now. What is it?”\n",
            "   “I think shes gone.”\n",
            "   “Gone?”\n",
            "   “Whole family moved out somewhere. But shes gone for good. I think shes dead.”\n",
            "   “We couldnt be talking about the same girl.”\n",
            "   “No. The same girl. McClellan. McClellan, Run over by a car. Four days ago. Im not sure. But I think shes dead. The family moved out anyway. I dont know. But I think shes dead.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sure of it!”\n",
            "   “No, not sure. Pretty sure.”\n",
            "   “Why didnt you tell me sooner?”\n",
            "   “Forgot.”\n",
            "   “Four days ago!”\n",
            "   “I forgot all about it.”\n",
            "   “Four days ago,” he said, quietly, lying there.\n",
            "   They lay there in the dark room not moving, either of them. “Good night,” she said.\n",
            "   He heard a faint rustle. Her hands moved. The electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow, touched by her hand. Now it was in her ear again, humming.\n",
            "   He listened and his wife was singing under her breath.\n",
            "   Outside the house, a shadow moved, an autumn wind rose up and faded away But there was something else in the silence that he heard. It was like a breath exhaled upon the window. It was like a faint drift of greenish luminescent smoke, the motion of a single huge October leaf blowing across the lawn and away.\n",
            "   The Hound, he thought. Its out there tonight. Its out there now. If I opened the window...\n",
            "   He did not open the window.\n",
            "   He had chills and fever in the morning.\n",
            "   “You cant be sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   He closed his eyes over the hotness. “Yes.”\n",
            "   “But you were all right last night.”\n",
            "   “No, I wasnt all right” He heard the “relatives” shouting in the parlour.\n",
            "   Mildred stood over his bed, curiously. He felt her there, he saw her without opening his eyes, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, her eyes with a kind of cataract unseen but suspect far behind the pupils, the reddened pouting lips, the body as thin as a praying mantis from dieting, and her flesh like white bacon. He could remember her no other way.\n",
            "   “Will you bring me aspirin and water?”\n",
            "   “Youve got to get up,” she said. “Its noon. Youve slept five hours later than usual.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn the parlour off?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Thats my family.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn it off for a sick man?”\n",
            "   “Ill turn it down.”\n",
            "   She went out of the room and did nothing to the parlour and came back. “Is that better?”\n",
            "   “Thanks.”\n",
            "   “Thats my favourite programme,” she said.\n",
            "   “What about the aspirin?”\n",
            "   “Youve never been sick before.” She went away again.\n",
            "   “Well, Im sick now. Im not going to work tonight. Call Beatty for me.”\n",
            "   “You acted funny last night.” She returned, humming.\n",
            "   “Wheres the aspirin?” He glanced at the water-glass she handed him.\n",
            "   “Oh.” She walked to the bathroom again. “Did something happen?”\n",
            "   “A fire, is all.”\n",
            "   “I had a nice evening,” she said, in the bathroom.\n",
            "   “What doing?”\n",
            "   “The parlour.”\n",
            "   “What was on?”\n",
            "   “Programmes.”\n",
            "   “What programmes?”\n",
            "   “Some of the best ever.”\n",
            "   “Who?”.\n",
            "   “Oh, you know, the bunch.”\n",
            "   “Yes, the bunch, the bunch, the bunch.” He pressed at the pain in his eyes and suddenly the odour of kerosene made him vomit.\n",
            "   Mildred came in, humming. She was surprised. “Whyd you do that?”\n",
            "   He looked with dismay at the floor. “We burned an old woman with her books.”\n",
            "   “Its a good thing the rugs washable.” She fetched a mop and worked on it. “I went to Helens last night.”\n",
            "   “Couldnt you get the shows in your own parlour?”\n",
            "   “Sure, but its nice visiting.”\n",
            "   She went out into the parlour. He heard her singing.\n",
            "   “Mildred?” he called.\n",
            "   She returned, singing, snapping her fingers softly.\n",
            "   “Arent you going to ask me about last night?” he said.\n",
            "   “What about it?”\n",
            "   “We burned a thousand books. We burned a woman.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   The parlour was exploding with sound.\n",
            "   “We burned copies of Dante and Swift and Marcus Aurelius.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a European?”\n",
            "   “Something like that.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a radical?”\n",
            "   “I never read him.”\n",
            "   “He was a radical.” Mildred fiddled with the telephone. “You dont expect me to call Captain Beatty, do you?”\n",
            "   “You must!”\n",
            "   “Dont shout!”\n",
            "   “I wasnt shouting.” He was up in bed, suddenly, enraged and flushed, shaking. The parlour roared in the hot air. “I cant call him. I cant tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   Because youre afraid, he thought. A child feigning illness, afraid to call because after a moments discussion, the conversation would run so: “Yes, Captain, I feel better already. Ill be in at ten oclock tonight.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag fell back in bed. He reached under his pillow. The hidden book was still there.\n",
            "   “Mildred, how would it be if, well, maybe, I quit my job awhile?”\n",
            "   “You want to give up everything? After all these years of working, because, one night, some woman and her books—”\n",
            "   “You should have seen her, Millie!”\n",
            "   “Shes nothing to me; she shouldnt have had books. It was her responsibility, she should have thought of that. I hate her. Shes got you going and  thing you know well be out, no house, no job, nothing.”\n",
            "   “You werent there, you didnt see,” he said. “There must be something in books, things we cant imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You dont stay for nothing.”\n",
            "   “She was simple-minded.”\n",
            "   “She was as rational as you and I, more so perhaps, and we burned her.”\n",
            "   “Thats water under the bridge.”\n",
            "   “No, not water; fire. You ever seen a burned house? It smoulders for days. Well, this firell last me the rest of my life. God! Ive been trying to put it out, in my mind, all night. Im crazy with trying.”\n",
            "   “You should have thought of that before becoming a fireman.”\n",
            "   “Thought!” he said. “Was I given a choice? My grandfather and father were firemen. In my sleep, I ran after them.”\n",
            "   The parlour was playing a dance tune.\n",
            "   “This is the day you go on the early shift,” said Mildred. “You should have gone two hours ago. I just noticed.”\n",
            "   “Its not just the woman that died,” said Montag. “Last night I thought about all the kerosene Ive used in the past ten years. And I thought about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And Id never even thought that thought before.” He got out of bed.\n",
            "   “It took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down, looking around at the world and life, and then I came along in two minutes and boom! its all over.”\n",
            "   “Let me alone,” said Mildred. “I didnt do anything.”\n",
            "   “Let you alone! Thats all very well, but how can I leave myself alone? We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?”\n",
            "   And then he shut up, for he remembered last week and the two white stones staring up at the ceiling and the pump-snake with the probing eye and the two soap-faced men with the cigarettes moving in their mouths when they talked. But that was another Mildred, that was a Mildred so deep inside this one, and so bothered, really bothered, that the two women had never met. He turned away.\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Well, now youve done it. Out front of the house. Look whos here.”.\n",
            "   “I dont care.”\n",
            "   “Theres a Phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt with an orange snake stitched on his arm coming up the front walk.”\n",
            "   “Captain Beauty?” he said,\n",
            "   “Captain Beatty.”\n",
            "   Montag did not move, but stood looking into the cold whiteness of the wall immediately before him.\n",
            "   “Go let him in, will you? Tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Tell him yourself!” She ran a few steps this way, a few steps that, and stopped, eyes wide, when the front door speaker called her name, softly, softly, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someones here. Fading.\n",
            "   Montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow, climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half-sitting, and after a while Mildred moved and went out of the room and Captain Beatty strolled in, his hands in his pockets.\n",
            "   “Shut the ‘relatives’ up,” said Beatty, looking around at everything except Montag and his wife.\n",
            "   This time, Mildred ran. The yammering voices stopped yelling in the parlour.\n",
            "   Captain Beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a peaceful look on his ruddy face. He took time to prepare and light his brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud. “Just thought Id come by and see how the sick man is.”\n",
            "   “Howd you guess?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his gums and the tiny candy whiteness of his teeth. “Ive seen it all. You were going to call for a night off.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “take the night off!” He examined his eternal matchbox, the lid of which said GUARANTEED: ONE MILLION LIGHTS IN THIS IGNITER, and began to strike the chemical match abstractedly, blow out, strike, blow out, strike, speak a few words, blow out. He looked at the flame. He blew, he looked at the smoke. “When will you be well?”\n",
            "   “Tomorrow. The  day maybe. First of the week.”\n",
            "   Beatty puffed his pipe. “Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession. They dont feed it to rookies like they used to. Damn shame.” Puff. “Only fire chiefs remember it now.” Puff. “Ill let you in on it.”\n",
            "   Mildred fidgeted.\n",
            "   Beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for what he wanted to say.\n",
            "   “When did it all start, you ask, this job of ours, how did it come about, where, when? Well, Id say it really got started around about a thing called the Civil War. Even though our rule-book claims it was founded earlier. The fact is we didnt get along well until photography came into its own. Then—motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed, not moving.\n",
            "   “And because they had mass, they became simpler,” said Beatty. “Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books levelled down to a sort of paste pudding norm, do you follow me?”\n",
            "   “I think so.”\n",
            "   Beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air. “Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending.”\n",
            "   “Snap ending.” Mildred nodded.\n",
            "   “Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a tenor twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: ‘now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.’ Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; theres your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.”\n",
            "   Mildred arose and began to move around the room, picking things up and putting them down. Beatty ignored her and continued\n",
            "   “Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl mans mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary, time-wasting thought!”\n",
            "   Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and jump again as she patted his pillow. Right now she was pulling at his shoulder to try to get him to move so she could take the pillow out and fix it nicely and put it back. And perhaps cry out and stare or simply reach down her hand and say, “Whats this?” and hold up the hidden book with touching innocence.\n",
            "   “School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages dropped, English and spelling gradually neglected, finally almost completely ignored. Life is immediate, the job counts, pleasure lies all about after work. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts?”\n",
            "   “Let me fix your pillow,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “No!” whispered Montag,\n",
            "   “The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at. dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.”\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Here.”\n",
            "   “Get away,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Life becomes one big pratfall, Montag; everything bang; boff, and wow!”\n",
            "   “Wow,” said Mildred, yanking at the pillow.\n",
            "   “For Gods sake, let me be!” cried Montag passionately.\n",
            "   Beatty opened his eyes wide.\n",
            "   Mildreds hand had frozen behind the pillow. Her fingers were tracing the books outline and as the shape became familiar her face looked surprised and then stunned. Her mouth opened to ask a question...\n",
            "   “Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colours running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or sauterne. You like baseball, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Baseballs a fine game.”\n",
            "   Now Beatty was almost invisible, a voice somewhere behind a screen of smoke\n",
            "   “Whats this?” asked Mildred, almost with delight. Montag heaved back against her arms. “Whats this here?”\n",
            "   “Sit down!” Montag shouted. She jumped away, her hands empty. “Were talking!”\n",
            "   Beatty went on as if nothing had happened. “You like bowling, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Bowling, yes.”\n",
            "   “And golf?”\n",
            "   “Golf is a fine game.”\n",
            "   “Basketball?”\n",
            "   “A fine game.”.\n",
            "   “Billiards, pool? Football?”\n",
            "   “Fine games, all of them.”\n",
            "   “More sports for everyone, group spirit, fun, and you dont have to think, eh? Organize and organize and superorganize super-super sports. More cartoons in books. More pictures. The mind drinks less and less. Impatience. Highways full of crowds going somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, nowhere. The gasoline refugee. Towns turn into motels, people in nomadic surges from place to place, following the moon tides, living tonight in the room where you slept this noon and I the night before.”\n",
            "   Mildred went out of the room and slammed the door. The parlour “aunts” began to laugh at the parlour “uncles.”,\n",
            "   “Now lets take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Dont step on the toes of the dog?lovers, the cat?lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second?generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic?books survive. And the three?dimensional sex?magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didnt come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade?journals.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but what about the firemen, then?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Ah.” Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. “What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word ‘intellectual,’ of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally ‘bright,’ did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasnt it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house  door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach mans mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well?read man? Me? I wont stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. Thats you, Montag, and thats me.”\n",
            "   The door to the parlour opened and Mildred stood there looking in at them, looking at Beatty and then at Montag. Behind her the walls of the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of trap?drums, tom?toms, and cymbals. Her mouth moved and she was saying something but the sound covered it.\n",
            "   Beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand, studied the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for meaning.\n",
            "   “You must understand that our civilization is so vast that we cant have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isnt that right? Havent you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well, arent they? Dont we keep them moving, dont we give them fun? Thats all we live for, isnt it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these.”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Montag could lip?read what Mildred was saying in the doorway. He tried not to look at her mouth, because then Beatty might turn and read what was there, too.\n",
            "   “Coloured people dont like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people dont feel good about Uncle Toms Cabin. Burn it. Someones written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Bum the book. Serenity, Montag. Peace, Montag. Take your fight outside. Better yet, into the incinerator. Funerals are unhappy and pagan? Eliminate them, too. Five minutes after a person is dead hes on his way to the Big Flue, the Incinerators serviced by helicopters all over the country. Ten minutes after death a mans a speck of black dust. Lets not quibble over individuals with memoriams. Forget them. Burn them all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean.”\n",
            "   The fireworks died in the parlour behind Mildred. She had stopped talking at the same time; a miraculous coincidence. Montag held his breath.\n",
            "   “There was a girl  door,” he said, slowly. “Shes gone now, I think, dead. I cant even remember her face. But she was different. How?how did she happen?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled. “Here or there, thats bound to occur. Clarisse McClellan? Weve a record on her family. Weve watched them carefully. Heredity and environment are funny things. You cant rid yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. Thats why weve lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now were almost snatching them from the cradle. We had some false alarms on the McClellans, when they lived in Chicago. Never found a book. Uncle had a mixed record; anti?social. The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, Im sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didnt want to know how a thing was done, but why. That can be embarrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girls better off dead.”\n",
            "   “Yes, dead.”\n",
            "   “Luckily, queer ones like her dont happen, often. We know how to nip most of them in the bud, early. You cant build a house without nails and wood. If you dont want a house built, hide the nails and wood. If you dont want a man unhappy politically, dont give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the Government is inefficient, top?heavy, and tax?mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of non?combustible data, chock them so damned full of ‘facts’ they feel stuffed, but absolutely ‘brilliant’ with information. Then theyll feel theyre thinking, theyll get a sense of motion without moving. And theyll be happy, because facts of that sort dont change. Dont give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide?rule, measure, and equate the universe, which just wont be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely. I know, Ive tried it; to hell with it. So bring on your clubs and parties, your acrobats and magicians, your dare-devils, jet cars, motor?cycle helicopters, your sex and heroin, more of everything to do with automatic reflex. If the drama is bad, if the film says nothing, if the play is hollow, sting me with the theremin, loudly. Ill think Im responding to the play, when its only a tactile reaction to vibration. But I dont care. I just like solid entertainment.”\n",
            "   Beatty got up. “I must be going. Lectures over. I hope Ive clarified things. The important thing for you to remember, Montag, is were the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dyke. Hold steady. Dont let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world. We depend on you. I dont think you realize how important you are, to our happy world as it stands now.”\n",
            "   Beatty shook Montags limp hand. Montag still sat, as if the house were collapsing about him and he could not move, in the bed. Mildred had vanished from the door.\n",
            "   “One last thing,” said Beatty. “At least once in his career, every fireman gets an itch. What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, Ive had to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. Theyre about non?existent people, figments of imagination, if theyre fiction. And if theyre non?fiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher screaming down anothers gullet. All of them running about, putting out the stars and extinguishing the sun. You come away lost.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, what if a fireman accidentally, really not, intending anything, takes a book home with him?”\n",
            "   Montag twitched. The open door looked at him with its great vacant eye.\n",
            "   “A natural error. Curiosity alone,” said Beatty. “We dont get over?anxious or mad. We let the fireman keep the book twenty?four hours. If he hasnt burned it by then, we simply come and burn it for him.”\n",
            "   “Of course.” Montags mouth was dry.\n",
            "   “Well, Montag. Will you take another, later shift, today? Will we see you tonight perhaps?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What?” Beatty looked faintly surprised.\n",
            "   Montag shut his eyes. “Ill be in later. Maybe.”\n",
            "   “Wed certainly miss you if you didnt show,” said Beatty, putting his pipe in his pocket thoughtfully.\n",
            "   Ill never come in again, thought Montag.\n",
            "   “Get well and keep well,” said Beatty.\n",
            "   He turned and went out through the open door.\n",
            "   Montag watched through the window as Beatty drove away in his gleaming yellow?flame?coloured beetle with the black, char?coloured tyres.\n",
            "   Across the street and down the way the other houses stood with their flat fronts. What was it Clarisse had said one afternoon? “No front porches. My uncle says there used to be front porches. And people sat there sometimes at night, talking when they wanted to talk, rocking, and not talking when they didnt want to talk. Sometimes they just sat there and thought about things, turned things over. My uncle says the architects got rid of the front porches because they didnt look well. But my uncle says that was merely rationalizing it; the real reason, hidden underneath, might be they didnt want people sitting like that, doing nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life. People talked too much. And they had time to think. So they ran off with the porches. And the gardens, too. Not many gardens any more to sit around in. And look at the furniture. No rocking?chairs any more. Theyre too comfortable. Get people up and running around. My uncle says... and... my uncle... and... my uncle...” Her voice faded.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Montag turned and looked at his wife, who sat in the middle of the parlour talking to an announcer, who in turn was talking to her. “Mrs. Montag,” he was saying. This, that and the other. “Mrs. Montag?” Something else and still another. The converter attachment, which had cost them one hundred dollars, automatically supplied her name whenever the announcer addressed his anonymous audience, leaving a blank where the proper syllables could be filled in. A special spot?wavex?scrambler also caused his televised image, in the area immediately about his lips, to mouth the vowels and consonants beautifully. He was a friend, no doubt of it, a good friend. “Mrs. Montag?now look right here.”\n",
            "   Her head turned. Though she quite obviously was not listening.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Its only a step from not going to work today to not working tomorrow, to not working at the firehouse ever again.”,\n",
            "   “You are going to work tonight, though, arent you?” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “I havent decided. Right now Ive got an awful feeling I want to smash things and kill things:\n",
            "   “Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No thanks.”\n",
            "   “The keys to the beetle are on the night table. I always like to drive fast when I feel that way. You get it up around ninetyfive and you feel wonderful. Sometimes I drive all night and come back and you dont know it. Its fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs. Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No, I dont want to, this time. I want to hold on to this funny thing. God, its gotten big on me. I dont know what it is. Im so damned unhappy, Im so mad, and I dont know why I feel like Im putting on weight. I feel fat. I feel like Ive been saving up a lot of things, and dont know what. I might even start reading books.”\n",
            "   “Theyd put you in jail, wouldnt they?” She looked at him as if he were behind the glass wall.\n",
            "   He began to put on his clothes, moving restlessly about the bedroom. “Yes, and it might be a good idea. Before I hurt someone. Did you hear Beatty? Did you listen to him? He knows all the answers. Hes right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept sitting there saying to myself, Im not happy, Im not happy.”\n",
            "   “I am.” Mildreds mouth beamed. “And proud of it.”\n",
            "   “Im going to do something,” said Montag. “I dont even know what yet, but Im going to do something big.”\n",
            "   “Im tired of listening to this junk,” said Mildred, turning from him to the announcer again\n",
            "   Montag touched the volume control in the wall and the announcer was speechless.\n",
            "   “Millie?” He paused. “This is your house as well as mine. I feel its only fair that I tell you something now. I should have told you before, but I wasnt even admitting it to myself. I have something I want you to see, something Ive put away and hid during the past year, now and again, once in a while, I didnt know why, but I did it and I never told you.”\n",
            "   He took hold of a straight?backed chair and moved it slowly and steadily into the hall near the front door and climbed up on it and stood for a moment like a statue on a pedestal, his wife standing under him, waiting. Then he reached up and pulled back the grille of the air?conditioning system and reached far back inside to the right and moved still another sliding sheet of metal and took out a book. Without looking at it he dropped it to the floor. He put his hand back up and took out two books and moved his hand down and dropped the two books to the floor. He kept moving his hand and dropping books, small ones, fairly large ones, yellow, red, green ones. When he was done he looked down upon some twenty books lying at his wifes feet.\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” he said. “I didnt really think. But now it looks as if were in this together.”\n",
            "   Mildred backed away as if she were suddenly confronted by a pack of mice that had come up out of the floor. He could hear her breathing rapidly and her face was paled out and her eyes were fastened wide. She said his name over, twice, three times. Then moaning, she ran forward, seized a book and ran toward the kitchen incinerator.\n",
            "   He caught her, shrieking. He held her and she tried to fight away from him, scratching.\n",
            "   “No, Millie, no! Wait! Stop it, will you? You dont know... stop it!” He slapped her face, he grabbed her again and shook her.\n",
            "   She said his name and began to cry.\n",
            "   “Millie!” he said. “Listen. Give me a second, will you? We cant do anything. We cant burn these. I want to look at them, at least look at them once. Then if what the Captain says is true, well burn them together, believe me, well burn them together. You must help me.” He looked down into her face and took hold of her chin and held her firmly. He was looking not only at her, but for himself and what he must do, in her face. “Whether we like this or not, were in it. Ive never asked for much from you in all these years, but I ask it now, I plead for it. Weve got to start somewhere here, figuring out why were in such a mess, you and the medicine at night, and the car, and me and my work. Were heading right for the cliff, Millie. God, I dont want to go over. This isnt going to be easy. We havent anything to go on, but maybe we can piece it out and figure it and help each other. I need you so much right now, I cant tell you. If you love me at all youll put up with this, twenty?four, forty?eight hours, thats all I ask, then itll be over. I promise, I swear! And if there is something here, just one little thing out of a whole mess of things, maybe we can pass it on to someone else.”\n",
            "   She wasnt fighting any more, so he let her go. She sagged away from him and slid down the wall, and sat on the floor looking at the books. Her foot touched one and she saw this and pulled her foot away.\n",
            "   “That woman, the other night, Millie, you werent there. You didnt see her face. And Clarisse. You never talked to her. I talked to her. And men like Beatty are afraid of her. I cant understand it. Why should they be so afraid of someone like her? But I kept putting her alongside the firemen in the house last night, and I suddenly realized I didnt like them at all, and I didnt like myself at all any more. And I thought maybe it would be best if the firemen themselves were burnt.”\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   The front door voice called softly:\n",
            "   “Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here.”\n",
            "   Softly.\n",
            "   They turned to stare at the door and the books toppled everywhere, everywhere in heaps.\n",
            "   “Beatty!” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “It cant be him.”\n",
            "   “Hes come back!” she whispered.\n",
            "   The front door voice called again softly. “Someone here...”\n",
            "   “We wont answer.” Montag lay back against the wall and then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books, bewilderedly, with his thumb, his forefinger. He was shivering and he wanted above all to shove the books up through the ventilator again, but he knew he could not face Beatty again. He crouched and then he sat and the voice of the front door spoke again, more insistently. Montag picked a single small volume from the floor. “Where do we begin?” He opened the book half?way and peered at it. “We begin by beginning, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Hell come in,” said Mildred, “and burn us and the books!”\n",
            "   The front door voice faded at last. There was a silence. Montag felt the presence of someone beyond the door, waiting, listening. Then the footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn.\n",
            "   “Lets see what this is,” said Montag.\n",
            "   He spoke the words haltingly and with a terrible selfconsciousness. He read a dozen pages here and there and came at last to this:\n",

They sat in the hall because the parlour was so empty and grey-looking without its walls lit with orange and yellow confetti and sky-rockets and women in gold-mesh dresses and men in black velvet pulling one-hundred-pound rabbits from silver hats. The parlour was dead and Mildred kept peering in at it with a blank expression as Montag paced the floor and came back and squatted down and read a page as many as ten times, aloud.\n",

            "   “But Clarisses favourite subject wasnt herself. It was everyone else, and me. She was the first person in a good many years Ive really liked. She was the first person I can remember who looked straight at me as if I counted.” He lifted the two books. “These men have been dead a long time, but I know their words point, one way or another, to Clansse.”\n",
            "   Outside the front door, in the rain, a faint scratching.\n",
            "   Montag froze. He saw Mildred thrust herself back to the wall and gasp.\n",
            "   “I shut it off.”\n",
            "   “Someone—the door—why doesnt the door-voice tell us—”\n",
            "   Under the door-sill, a slow, probing sniff, an exhalation of electric steam.\n",
            "   Mildred laughed. “Its only a dog, thats what! You want me to shoo him away?”\n",
            "   “Stay where you are!”\n",
            "   Silence. The cold rain falling. And the smell of blue electricity blowing under the locked door.\n",
            "   “Lets get back to work,” said Montag quietly.\n",
            "   Mildred kicked at a book. “Books arent people. You read and I look around, but there isnt anybody!”\n",
            "   He stared at the parlour that was dead and grey as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun.\n",
            "   “Now,” said Mildred, “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh! And the colours!”\n",
            "   “Yes, I know.”\n",
            "   “And besides, if Captain Beatty knew about those books—” She thought about it. Her face grew amazed and then horrified. “He might come and bum the house and the ‘family.’ Thats awful! Think of our investment. Why should I read? What for?”\n",
            "   “What for! Why!” said Montag. “I saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. It was dead but it was alive. It could see but it couldnt see. You want to see that snake. Its at Emergency Hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! Would you like to go and check their file? Maybe youd look under Guy Montag or maybe under Fear or War. Would you like to go to that house that burnt last night? And rake ashes for the bones of the woman who set fire to her own house! What about Clarisse McClellan, where do we look for her? The morgue! Listen!”\n",
            "   The bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house, gasping, murmuring, whistling like an immense, invisible fan, circling in emptiness.\n",
            "   “Jesus God,” said Montag. “Every hour so many damn things in the sky! How in hell did those bombers get up there every single second of our lives! Why doesnt someone want to talk about it? Weve started and won two atomic wars since 1960. Is it because were having so much fun at home weve forgotten the world? Is it because were so rich and the rest of the worlds so poor and we just dont care if they are? Ive heard rumours; the world is starving, but were well-fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why were hated so much? Ive heard the rumours about hate, too, once in a long while, over the years. Do you know why? I dont, thats sure! Maybe the books can get us half out of the cave. They just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes! I dont hear those idiot bastards in your parlour talking about it. God, Millie, dont you see? An hour a day, two hours, with these books, and maybe...”\n",
            "   The telephone rang. Mildred snatched the phone.\n",
            "   “Ann!” She laughed. “Yes, the White Clowns on tonight!”\n",
            "   Montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down. “Montag,” he said, “youre really stupid. Where do we go from here? Do we turn the books in, forget it?” He opened the book to read over Mildreds laughter.\n",
            "   Poor Millie, he thought. Poor Montag, its mud to you, too. But where do you get help, where do you find a teacher this late?\n",
            "   Hold on. He shut his eyes. Yes, of course. Again he found himself thinking of the green park a year ago. The thought had been with him many times recently, but now he remembered how it was that day in the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide something, quickly in his coat .\n",
            "   ...The old man leapt up as if to run. And Montag said, “Wait!”\n",
            "   “I havent done anything!” cried the old man trembling.\n",
            "   “No one said you did.”\n",
            "   They had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a moment, and then Montag talked about the weather, and then the old man responded with a pale voice. It was a strange quiet meeting. The old man admitted to being a retired English professor who had been thrown out upon the world forty years ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and patronage. His name was Faber, and when he finally lost his fear of Montag, he talked in a cadenced voice, looking at the sky and the trees and the green park, and when an hour had passed he said something to Montag and Montag sensed it was a rhymeless poem. Then the old man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was a poem, too. Faber held his hand over his left coat-pocket and spoke these words gently, and Montag knew if he reached out, he might pull a book of poetry from the mans coat. But he did not reach out. His. hands stayed on his knees, numbed and useless. “I dont talk things, sir,” said Faber. “I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know Im alive.”\n",
            "   That was all there was to it, really. An hour of monologue, a poem, a comment, and then without even acknowledging the fact that Montag was a fireman, Faber with a certain trembling, wrote his address on a slip of paper. “For your file,” he said, “in case you decide to be angry with me.”\n",
            "   “Im not angry,” Montag said, surprised.\n",
            "   Mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall.\n",
            "   Montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his file-wallet to the heading: FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS (?). Fabers name was there. He hadnt turned it in and he hadnt erased it.\n",
            "   He dialled the call on a secondary phone. The phone on the far end of the line called Fabers name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice. Montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence. “Yes, Mr. Montag?”\n",
            "   “Professor Faber, I have a rather odd question to ask. How many copies of the Bible are left in this country?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what youre talking about!”\n",
            "   “I want to know if there are any copies left at all.”\n",
            "   “This is some sort of a trap! I cant talk to just anyone on the phone!”\n",
            "   “How many copies of Shakespeare and Plato?”\n",
            "   “None! You know as well as I do. None!”\n",
            "   Faber hung up.\n",
            "   Montag put down the phone. None. A thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings. But somehow he had wanted to hear it from Faber himself.\n",
            "   In the hall Mildreds face was suffused with excitement. “Well, the ladies are coming over!”\n",
            "   Montag showed her a book. “This is the Old and New Testament, and-”\n",
            "   “Dont start that again!”\n",
            "   “It might be the last copy in this part of the world.”\n",
            "   “Youve got to hand it back tonight, dont you know? Captain Beatty knows youve got it, doesnt he?”\n",
            "   “I dont think he knows which book I stole. But how do I choose a substitute? Do I turn in Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Thoreau? Which is least valuable? If I pick a substitute and Beatty does know which book I stole, hell guess weve an entire library here!”\n",
            "   Mildreds mouth twitched. “See what youre doing? Youll ruin us! Whos more important, me or that Bible?” She was beginning to shriek now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat.\n",
            "   He could hear Beattys voice. “Sit down, Montag. Watch. Delicately, like the petals of a flower. Light the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly. Beautiful, eh? Light the third page from the second and so on, chainsmoking, chapter by chapter, all the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, all the second-hand notions and time-worn philosophies.” There sat Beatty, perspiring gently, the floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm\n",
            "   Mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started. Montag was not listening. “Theres only one thing to do,” he said. “Some time before tonight when I give the book to Beatty, Ive got to have a duplicate made.”\n",
            "   “Youll be here for the White Clown tonight, and the ladies coming over?” cried Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag stopped at the door, with his back turned. “Millie?”\n",
            "   A silence “What?”\n",
            "   “Millie? Does the White Clown love you?”\n",
            "   No answer.\n",
            "   “Millie, does—” He licked his lips. “Does your ‘family’ love you, love you very much, love you with all their heart\n",
            "   and soul, Millie?”\n",
            "   He felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck.\n",
            "   “Whyd you ask a silly question like that?”\n",
            "   He felt he wanted to cry, but nothing would happen to his eyes or his mouth.\n",
            "   “If you see that dog outside,” said Mildred, “give him a kick for me.”\n",
            "   He hesitated, listening at the door. He opened it and stepped out.\n",
            "   The rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky. The street and the lawn and the porch were empty. He let his breath go in a great sigh.\n",
            "   He slammed the door.\n",
            "   He was on the subway.\n",
            "   Im numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill-bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\n",
            "   The numbness will go away, he thought. Itll take time, but Ill do it, or Faber will do it for me. Someone somewhere will give me back the old face and the old hands the way they were. Even the smile, he thought, the old burnt-in smile, thats gone. Im lost without it.\n",
            "   The subway fled past him, cream-tile, jet-black, cream-tile, jet-black, numerals and darkness, more darkness and the total adding itself.\n",
            "   Once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the middle of the blue and hot summer day, trying to fill a sieve with sand, because some cruel cousin had said, “Fill this sieve and youll get a dime!” And the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through with a hot whispering. His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty. Seated there in the midst of July, without a sound, he felt the tears move down his cheeks.\n",
            "   Now as the vacuum-underground rushed him through the dead cellars of town, jolting him, he remembered the terrible logic of that sieve, and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the Bible open. There were people in the suction train but he held the book in his hands and the silly thought came to him, if you read fast and read all, maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve. But he read and the words fell through, and he thought, in a few hours, there will be Beatty, and here will be me handing this over, so no phrase must escape me, each line must be memorized. I will myself to do it.\n",
            "   He clenched the book in his fists.\n",
            "   Trumpets blared.\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentrifice.”\n",
            "   Shut up, thought Montag. Consider the lilies of the field.\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentifrice.”\n",
            "   They toil not—\n",
            "   “Denhams—”\n",
            "   Consider the lilies of the field, shut up, shut up.\n",
            "   “Dentifrice!”\n",
            "   He tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt them as if he were blind, he picked at the shape of the individual letters, not blinking.\n",
            "   “Denhams. Spelled: D-E. N”\n",
            "   They toil not, neither do they...\n",
            "   A fierce whisper of hot sand through empty sieve.\n",
            "   “Denhams does it!”\n",
            "   Consider the lilies, the lilies, the lilies...\n",
            "   “Denhams dental detergent.”\n",
            "   “Shut up, shut up, shut up!” It was a plea, a cry so terrible that Montag found himself on his feet, the shocked inhabitants of the loud car staring, moving back from this man with the insane, gorged face, the gibbering, dry mouth, the flapping book in his fist. The people who had been sitting a moment before, tapping their feet to the rhythm of Denhams Dentifrice, Denhams Dandy Dental Detergent, Denhams Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice, one two, one two three, one two, one two three. The people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the words Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice. The train radio vomited upon Montag, in retaliation, a great ton-load of music made of tin, copper, silver, chromium, and brass. The people wcre pounded into submission; they did not run, there was no place to run; the great air-train fell down its shaft in the earth.\n",
            "   “Lilies of the field.” “Denhams.”\n",
            "   “Lilies, I said!”\n",
            "   The people stared.\n",
            "   “Call the guard.”\n",
            "   “The mans off—”\n",
            "   “Knoll View!”\n",
            "   The train hissed to its stop.\n",
            "   “Knoll View!” A cry.\n",
            "   “Denhams.” A whisper.\n",
            "   Montags mouth barely moved. “Lilies...”\n",
            "   The train door whistled open. Montag stood. The door gasped, started shut. Only then. did he leap past the other passengers, screaming in his mind, plunge through the slicing door only in time. He ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels, ignoring the escalators, because he wanted to feel his feet-move, arms swing, lungs clench, unclench, feel his throat go raw with air. A voice drifted after him, “Denhams Denhams Denhams,” the train hissed like a snake. The train vanished in its hole.\n",
            "   “Who is it?”\n",
            "   “Montag out here.”\n",
            "   “What do you want?”\n",
            "   “Let me in.”\n",
            "   “I havent done anything l”\n",
            "   “Im alone, dammit!”\n",
            "   “You swear it?”\n",
            "   “I swear!”\n",
            "   The front door opened slowly. Faber peered out, looking very old in the light and very fragile and very much afraid. The old man looked as if he had not been out of the house in years. He and the white plaster walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded, with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the book under Montags arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile. Slowly his fear went.\n",
            "   “Im sorry. One has to be careful.”\n",
            "   He looked at the book under Montags arm and could not stop. “So its true.”\n",
            "   Montag stepped inside. The door shut.\n",
            "   “Sit down.” Faber backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desk-top. Montag had only a glimpse, before Faber, seeing Montags attention diverted, turned quickly and shut the bedroom door and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand. His gaze returned unsteadily to Montag, who was now seated with the book in his lap. “The book-where did you-?”\n",
            "   “I stole it.”\n",
            "   Faber, for the first time, raised his eyes and looked directly into Montags face. “Youre brave.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Montag. “My wifes dying. A friend of mines already dead. Someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twenty-four hours ago. Youre the only one I knew might help me. To see. To see..”\n",
            "   Fabers hands itched on his knees. “May I?”\n",
            "   “Sorry.” Montag gave him the book.\n",
            "   “Its been a long time. Im not a religious man. But its been a long time.” Faber turned the pages, stopping here and there to read. “Its as good as I remember. Lord, how theyve changed itin our ‘parlours’ these days. Christ is one of the ‘family’ now. I often wonder it God recognizes His own son the way weve dressed him up, or is it dressed him down? Hes a regular peppermint stick now, all sugar-crystal and saccharine when he isnt making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs.” Faber sniffed the book. “Do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land? I loved to smell them when I was a boy. Lord, there were a lot of lovely books once, before we let them go.” Faber turned the pages. “Mr. Montag, you are looking at a coward. I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. Im one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the ‘guilty,’ but I did not speak and thus became guilty myself. And when finally they set the structure to burn the books, using the, firemen, I grunted a few times and subsided, for there were no others grunting or yelling with me, by then. Now, its too late.” Faber closed the Bible. “Well—suppose you tell me why you came here?”\n",
            "   “Nobody listens any more. I cant talk to the walls because theyre yelling at me. I cant talk to my wife; she listens to the walls. I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, itll make sense. And I want you to teach me to understand what I read.”\n",
            "   Faber examined Montags thin, blue-jowled face. “How did you get shaken up? What knocked the torch out of your hands?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we arent happy. Somethings missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books Id burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.”\n",
            "   “Youre a hopeless romantic,” said Faber. “It would be funny if it were not serious. Its not books you need, its some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the ‘parlour families’ today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, its not books at all youre looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldnt know this, of course you still cant understand what I mean when I say all this. You are intuitively right, thats what counts. Three things are missing.\n",
            "   “Number one: Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. Youd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. Thats my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\n",
            "   “So now do you see why books are hated and feared? They show the pores in the face of life. The comfortable people want only wax moon faces, poreless, hairless, expressionless. We are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers, instead of growing on good rain and black loam. Even fireworks, for all their prettiness, come from the chemistry of the earth. Yet somehow we think we can grow, feeding on flowers and fireworks, without completing the cycle back to reality. Do you know the legend of Hercules and Antaeus, the giant wrestler, whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth. But when he was held, rootless, in mid-air, by Hercules, he perished easily. If there isnt something in that legend for us today, in this city, in our time, then I am completely insane. Well, there we have the first thing I said we needed. Quality, texture of information.”\n",
            "   “And the second?”\n",
            "   “Leisure.”\n",
            "   “Oh, but weve plenty of off-hours.”\n",
            "   “Off-hours, yes. But time to think? If youre not driving a hundred miles an hour, at a clip where you cant think of anything else but the danger, then youre playing some game or sitting in some room where you cant argue with the fourwall televisor. Why? The televisor is ‘real.’ It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be, right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasnt time to protest, ‘What nonsense!”\n",
            "   “Only the ‘family’ is ‘people.’”\n",
            "   “I beg your pardon?”\n",
            "   “My wife says books arent ‘real.’”\n",
            "   “Thank God for that. You can shut them, say, ‘Hold on a moment.’ You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlour? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is the truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and scepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full colour, three dimensions, and I being in and part of those incredible parlours. As you see, my parlour is nothing but four plaster walls. And here” He held out two small rubber plugs. “For my ears when I ride the subway-jets.”\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentifrice; they toil not, neither do they spin,” said Montag, eyes shut. “Where do we go from here? Would books help us?”\n",
            "   “Only if the third necessary thing could be given us. Number one, as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the inter-action of the first two. And I hardly think a very old man and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game...”\n",
            "   “I can get books.”\n",

            "   “There, youve said an interesting thing,” laughed Faber, “without having read it!”\n",
            "   “Are things like that in books. But it came off the top of my mind!”\n",
            "   “All the better. You didnt fancy it up for me or anyone, even yourself.”\n",
            "   Montag leaned forward. “This afternoon I thought that if it turned out that books were worth while, we might get a press and print some extra copies—”\n",
            "   “ We?”\n",
            "   “You and I”\n",

            "   “Not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for my trouble. The only way I could possibly listen to you would be if somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt. Now if you suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in firemens houses all over the country, so that seeds of suspicion would be sown among these arsonists, bravo, Id say!”\n",
            "   “Plant the books, turn in an alarm, and see the firemens houses bum, is that what you mean?”\n",

We do need knowledge. And perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off. The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are. Theyre Caesars praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, ‘Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.’ Most of us cant rush around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we havent time, money or that many friends. The things youre looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Dont ask for guarantees. And dont look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.”\n",

Good God, it isnt as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord. You firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze, but its a small sideshow indeed, and hardly necessary to keep things in line. So few want to be rebels any more. And out of those few, most, like myself, scare easily. Can you dance faster than the White Clown, shout louder than ‘Mr. Gimmick’ and the parlour ‘families’?

How like a beautiful statue of ice it was, melting in the sun. I remember the newspapers dying like huge moths. No one wanted them back. No one missed them. And the Government, seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about passionate lips and the fist in the stomach, circled the situation with your fire-eaters. So, Montag, theres this unemployed printer. We might start a few books, and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us the push we need. A few bombs and the ‘families’ in the walls of all the houses, like harlequin rats, will shut up! In silence, our stage-whisper might carry.”\n",

That day in the park when we sat together, I knew that some day you might drop by, with fire or friendship, it was hard to guess. Ive had this little item ready for months.

Im the Queen Bee, safe in the hive. You will be the drone, the travelling ear. Eventually, I could put out ears into all parts of the city, with various men, listening and evaluating. If the drones die, Im still safe at home, tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of chance. See how safe I play it, how contemptible I am?”\n",

Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came through the front door and vanished into the volcanos mouth with martinis in their hands: Montag stopped eating. They were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw their Cheshire Cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and now they were screaming at each other above the din. Montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his mouth.\n",

            "   On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought Montag, insanely. In the other walls an X-ray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delightful stomach! Abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into the clouds, it plunged into a lime-green sea where blue fish ate red and yellow fish. A minute later, Three White Cartoon Clowns chopped off each others limbs to the accompaniment of immense incoming tides of laughter. Two minutes more and the room whipped out of town to the jet cars wildly circling an arena, bashing and backing up and bashing each other again. Montag saw a number of bodies fly in the air.\n",

            "   “When do you suppose the war will start?” he said. “I notice your husbands arent here tonight?”\n",
            "   “Oh, they come and go, come and go,” said Mrs. Phelps. “In again out again Finnegan, the Army called Pete yesterday. Hell be back  week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and everyone home. Thats what the Army said. Quick war. Pete was called yesterday and they said hed be, back  week. Quick...”\n",
            "   The three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty mud-coloured walls.\n",
            "   “Im not worried,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Ill let Pete do all the worrying.” She giggled. “Ill let old Pete do all the worrying. Not me. Im not worried.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” said Millie. “Let old Pete do the worrying.”\n",
            "   “Its always someone elses husband dies, they say.”\n",
            "   “Ive heard that, too. Ive never known any dead man killed in a war. Killed jumping off buildings, yes, like Glorias husband last week, but from wars? No.”\n",
            "   “Not from wars,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Anyway, Pete and I always said, no tears, nothing like that. Its our third marriage each and were independent. Be independent, we always said. He said, if I get killed off, you just go right ahead and dont cry, but get married again, and dont think of me.”\n",
            "   “That reminds me,” said Mildred. “Did you see that Clara Dove five-minute romance last night in your wall? Well, it was all about this woman who—”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but stood looking at the womens faces as he had once looked at the faces of saints in a strange church he had entered when he was a child. The faces of those enamelled creatures meant nothing to him, though he talked to them and stood in that church for a long time, trying to be of that religion, trying to know what that religion was, trying to get enough of the raw incense and special dust of the place into his lungs and thus into his blood to feel touched and concerned by the meaning of the colourful men and women with the porcelain eyes and the blood-ruby lips. But there was nothing, nothing; it was a stroll through another store, and his currency strange and unusable there, and his passion cold, even when he touched the wood and plaster and clay. So it was now, in his own parlour, with these women twisting in their chairs under his gaze, lighting cigarettes, blowing smoke, touching their sun-fired hair and examining their blazing fingernails as if they had caught fire from his look. Their faces grew haunted with silence. They leaned forward at the sound of Montags swallowing his final bite of food. They listened to his feverish breathing. The three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows of sleeping giants now, empty of dreams. Montag felt that if you touched these three staring brows you would feel a fine salt sweat on your finger-tips. The perspiration gathered with the silence and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with tension. Any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode.\n",
            "   Montag moved his lips.\n",
            "   “Lets talk.”\n",
            "   The women jerked and stared.\n",
            "   “Howre your children, Mrs. Phelps?” he asked.\n",
            "   “You know I havent any! No one in his right mind, the Good Lord knows; would have children!” said Mrs. Phelps, not quite sure why she was angry with this man.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt say that,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Ive had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and thats nice. Two Caesarians tamed the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians arent necessary; youve got the, hips for it, everythings normal, but I insisted.”\n",
            "   “Caesarians or not, children are ruinous; youre out of your mind,” said Mrs. Phelps.\n",
            "   “I plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. I put up with them when they come home three days a month; its not bad at all. You heave them into the ‘parlour’ and turn the switch. Its like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid.” Mrs. Bowles tittered. “Theyd just as soon kick as kiss me. Thank God, I can kick back!”\n",
            "   The women showed their tongues, laughing.\n",
            "   Mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that Montag was still in the doorway, clapped her hands. “Lets talk politics, to please Guy!”\n",
            "   “Sounds fine,” said Mrs. Bowles. “I voted last election, same as everyone, and I laid it on the line for President Noble. I think hes one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president.”\n",
            "   “Oh, but the man they ran against him!”\n",
            "   “He wasnt much, was he? Kind of small and homely and he didnt shave too close or comb his hair very well.”\n",
            "   “What possessed the ‘Outs’ to run him? You just dont go running a little short man like that against a tall man. Besides -he mumbled. Half the time I couldnt hear a word he said. And the words I did hear I didnt understand!”\n",
            "   “Fat, too, and didnt dress to hide it. No wonder the landslide was for Winston Noble. Even their names helped. Compare Winston Noble to Hubert Hoag for ten seconds and you can almost figure the results.”\n",
            "   “Damn it!” cried Montag. “What do you know about Hoag and Noble?”\n",
            "   “Why, they were right in that parlour wall, not six months ago. One was always picking his nose; it drove me wild.”\n",
            "   “Well, Mr. Montag,” said Mrs. Phelps, “do you want us to vote for a man like that?”\n",
            "   Mildred beamed. “You just run away from the door, Guy, and dont make us nervous.”\n",
            "   But Montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his hand.\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   “Damn it all, damn it all, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Whatve you got there; isnt that a book? I thought that all special training these days was done by film.” Mrs. Phelps blinked. “You reading up on fireman theory?”\n",
            "   “Theory, hell,” said Montag. “Its poetry.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” A whisper.\n",
            "   “Leave me alone!” Montag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum.\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on, dont...”\n",
            "   “Did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about monsters? Oh God, the way they jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their husbands and the way they talk about war, dammit, I stand here and I cant believe it!”\n",
            "   “I didnt say a single word about any war, Ill have you know,” said Mrs, Phelps.\n",
            "   “As for poetry, I hate it,” said Mrs. Bowles.\n",
            "   “Have you ever read any?”\n",
            "   “Montag,” Fabers voice scraped away at him. “Youll ruin everything. Shut up, you fool!”\n",

            "   “Why dont you just read us one of those poems from your little book,” Mrs. Phelps nodded. “I think thatd he very interesting.”\n",
            "   “Thats not right,” wailed Mrs. Bowles. “We cant do that!”\n",
            "   “Well, look at Mr. Montag, he wants to, I know he does. And if we listen nice, Mr. Montag will be happy and then maybe we can go on and do something else.” She glanced nervously at the long emptiness of the walls enclosing them.\n",
            "   “Montag, go through with this and Ill cut off, Ill leave.” The beetle jabbed his ear. “What good is this, whatll you prove?”\n",
            "   “Scare hell out of them, thats what, scare the living daylights out!”\n",
            "   Mildred looked at the empty air. “Now Guy, just who are you talking to?”\n",
            "   A silver needle pierced his brain. “Montag, listen, only one way out, play it as a joke, cover up, pretend you arent mad at all. Then-walk to your wall-incinerator, and throw the book in!”\n",
            "   Mildred had already anticipated this in a quavery voice. “Ladies, once a year, every firemans allowed to bring one book home, from the old days, to show his family how silly it all was, how nervous that sort of thing can make you, how crazy. Guys surprise tonight is to read you one sample to show how mixed-up things were, so none of us will ever have to bother our little old heads about that junk again, isnt that right, darling?”\n",
            "   He crushed the book in his fists. “Say ‘yes.’”\n",
            "   His mouth moved like Fabers.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Mildred snatched the book with a laugh. “Here! Read this one. No, I take it back. Heres that real funny one you read out loud today. Ladies, you wont understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go ahead, Guy, that page, dear.”\n",
            "   He looked at the opened page.\n",
            "   A fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. “Read.”\n",

Then he began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there in the great hot emptiness:\n",

            "   \n",
            "   The others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed itself out of shape. They sat, not touching her, bewildered by her display. She sobbed uncontrollably. Montag himself was stunned and shaken.\n",
            "   “Sh, sh,” said Mildred. “Youre all right, Clara, now, Clara, snap out of it! Clara, whats wrong?”\n",
            "   “I-I,”, sobbed Mrs. Phelps, “dont know, dont know, I just dont know, oh oh...”\n",
            "   Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. “You see? I knew it, thats what I wanted to prove! I knew it would happen! Ive always said, poetry and tears, poetry and suicide and crying and awful feelings, poetry and sickness; all that mush! Now Ive had it proved to me. Youre nasty, Mr. Montag, youre nasty!”\n",
            "   Faber said, “Now...”\n",
            "   Montag felt himself turn and walk to the wall-slot and drop the book in through the brass notch to the waiting flames.\n",
            "   “Silly words, silly words, silly awful hurting words,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Why do people want to hurt people? Not enough hurt in the world, youve got to tease people with stuff like that!”\n",
            "   “Clara, now, Clara,” begged Mildred, pulling her arm. “Come on, lets be cheery, you turn the ‘family’ on, now. Go ahead. Lets laugh and be happy, now, stop crying, well have a party!”\n",
            "   “No,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Im trotting right straight home. You want to visit my house and ‘family,’ well and good. But I wont come in this firemans crazy house again in my lifetime!”\n",
            "   “Go home.” Montag fixed his eyes upon her, quietly. “Go home and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, go home and think of the dozen abortions youve had, go home and think of that and your damn Caesarian sections, too, and your children who hate your guts! Go home and think how it all happened and what did you ever do to stop it? Go home, go home!” he yelled. “Before I knock you down and kick you out of the door!”\n",
            "   Doors slammed and the house was empty. Montag stood alone in the winter weather, with the parlour walls the colour of dirty snow.\n",
            "   In the bathroom, water ran. He heard Mildred shake the sleeping tablets into her hand.\n",
            "   “Fool, Montag, fool, fool, oh God you silly fool...”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” He pulled the green bullet from his ear and jammed it into his pocket.\n",
            "   It sizzled faintly. “...fool... fool...”\n",
            "   He searched the house and found the books where Mildred had stacked them behind the refrigerator. Some were missing and he knew that she had started on her own slow process of dispersing the dynamite in her house, stick by stick. But he was not angry now, only exhausted and bewildered with himself. He carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning.\n",
            "   He went back through the house. “Mildred?” He called at the door of the darkened bedroom. There was no sound.\n",
            "   Outside, crossing the lawn, on his way to work, he tried not to see how completely dark and deserted Clarisse McClellans house was...\n",
            "   On the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the night. Already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known Faber a lifetime. Now he knew that he was two people, that he was above all Montag, who knew nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it. And he knew that he was also the old man who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one end of the night city to the other on one long sickening gasp of motion. In the days to follow, and in the nights when there was no moon and in the nights when there was a very bright moon shining on the earth, the old man would go on with this talking and this talking, drop by drop, stone by stone, flake by flake. His mind would well over at last and he would not be Montag any more, this the old man told him, assured him, promised him. He would be Montag-plus-Faber, fire plus water, and then, one day, after everything had mixed and simmered and worked away in silence, there would be neither fire nor water, but wine. Out of two separate and opposite things, a third. And one day he would look back upon the fool and know the fool. Even now he could feel the start of the long journey, the leave-taking, the going away from the self he had been.\n",
            "   It was good listening to the beetle hum, the sleepy mosquito buzz and delicate filigree murmur of the old mans voice at first scolding him and then consoling him in the late hour of night as he emerged from the steaming subway toward the firehouse world.\n",
            "   “Pity, Montag, pity. Dont haggle and nag them; you were so recently one o f them yourself. They are so confident that they will run on for ever. But they wont run on. They dont know that this is all one huge big blazing meteor that makes a pretty fire in space, but that some day itll have to hit. They see only the blaze, the pretty fire, as you saw it.\n",
            "   “Montag, old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanut-brittle bones, have no right to criticize. Yet you almost killed things at the start. Watch it! Im with you, remember that. I understand how it happened. I must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. God, how young I felt! But now-I want you to feel old, I want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you tonight. The  few hours, when you see Captain Beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for you, let me feel the situation out. Survival is our ticket. Forget the poor, silly women...”\n",
            "   “I made them unhappier than they have been in years, Ithink,” said Montag. “It shocked me to see Mrs. Phelps cry. Maybe theyre right, maybe its best not to face things, to run, have fun. I dont know. I feel guilty—”\n",
            "   “No, you mustnt! If there were no war, if there was peace in the world, Id say fine, have fun! But, Montag, you mustnt go back to being just a fireman. All isnt well with the world.”\n",
            "   Montag perspired.\n",
            "   “Montag, you listening?”\n",
            "   “My feet,” said Montag. “I cant move them. I feel so damn silly. My feet wont move!”\n",
            "   “Listen. Easy now,” said the old man gently. “I know, I know. Youre afraid of making mistakes. Dont be. Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in peoples faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and youll never learn. Now, pick up your feet, into the firehouse with you! Were twins, were not alone any more, were not separated out in different parlours, with no contact between. If you need help when Beatty pries at you, Ill be sitting right here in your eardrum making notes!”\n",
            "   Montag felt his right foot, then his left foot, move.\n",
            "   “Old man,” he said, “stay with me.”\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound was gone. Its kennel was empty and the firehouse stood all about in plaster silence and the orange Salamander slept with its kerosene in its belly and the firethrowers crossed upon its flanks and Montag came in through the silence and touched the brass pole and slid up in the dark air, looking back at the deserted kennel, his heart beating, pausing, beating. Faber was a grey moth asleep in his ear, for the moment.\n",
            "   Beatty stood near the drop-hole waiting, but with his back turned as if he were not waiting.\n",
            "   “Well,” he said to the men playing cards, “here comes a very strange beast which in all tongues is called a fool.”\n",
            "   He put his hand to one side, palm up, for a gift. Montag put the book in it. Without even glancing at the title, Beatty tossed the book into the trash-basket and lit a cigarette. “‘Who are a little wise, the best fools be.’ Welcome back, Montag. I hope youll be staying, with us, now that your fever is done and your sickness over. Sit in for a hand of poker?”\n",
            "   They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beattys sight, Montag felt the guilt of his hands. His fingers were like ferrets that had done some evil and now never rested, always stirred and picked and hid in pockets, moving from under Beattys alcohol-flame stare. If Beatty so much as breathed on them, Montag felt that his hands might wither, turn over on their sides, and never be shocked to life again; they would be buried the rest of his life in his coat-sleeves, forgotten. For these were the hands that had acted on their own, no part of him, here was where the conscience first manifested itself to snatch books, dart off with job and Ruth and Willie Shakespeare, and now, in the firehouse, these hands seemed gloved with blood.\n",
            "   Twice in half an hour, Montag had to rise from the game and go to the latrine to wash his hands. When he came back he hid his hands under the table.\n",
            "   Beatty laughed. “Lets have your hands in sight, Montag.\n",
            "   Not that we dont trust you, understand, but—”\n",
            "   They all laughed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “the crisis is past and all is well, the sheep returns to the fold. Were all sheep who have strayed at times. Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning, weve cried. They are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts, weve shouted to ourselves. ‘Sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge,’ Sir Philip Sidney said. But on the other hand: ‘Words are like leaves and where they most abound, Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.’ Alexander Pope. What do you think of that?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Careful,” whispered Faber, living in another world, far away.\n",
            "   “Or this? ‘A little learning is a dangerous thing. Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring; There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again.’ Pope. Same Essay. Where does that put you?”\n",
            "   Montag bit his lip.\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” said Beatty, smiling at his cards. “That made you for a little while a drunkard. Read a few lines and off you go over the cliff. Bang, youre ready to blow up the world, chop off heads, knock down women and children, destroy authority. I know, Ive been through it all.”\n",
            "   “Im all right,” said Montag, nervously.\n",
            "   “Stop blushing. Im not needling, really Im not. Do you know, I had a dream an hour ago. I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said ‘Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!’ And I said, ‘Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that “He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.’” Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!”\n",
            "   “Dont listen,” whispered Faber. “Hes trying to confuse. Hes slippery. Watch out!”\n",
            "   Beatty chuckled. “And you said, quoting, ‘Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!’ And I cried in good humour, ‘Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!’ And ‘The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.’ And you yelled, ‘This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than of a threadbare saint in wisdoms school!’ And I whispered gently, ‘The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.’ And you screamed, ‘Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!’ And I said, patting your hand, ‘What, do I give you trench mouth?’ And you shrieked, ‘Knowledge is power!’ and ‘A dwarf on a giants shoulders of the furthest of the two!’ and I summed my side up with rare serenity in, ‘The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr. Valery once said.’”\n",
            "   Montags head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, “No! shut up, youre confusing things, stop it!” Beattys graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist.\n",
            "   “God, what a pulse! Ive got you going, have I, Montag. Jesus God, your pulse sounds like the day after the war. Everything but sirens and bells! Shall I talk some more? I like your look of panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I speak them all. A kind of excellent dumb discourse, Willie!”\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on!” The moth brushed Montags ear. “Hes muddying the waters!”\n",
            "   “Oh, you were scared silly,” said Beatty, “for I was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You think theyre backing you up, and they turn on you. Others can use them, too, and there you are, lost in the middle of the moor, in a great welter of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the very end of my dream, along I came with the Salamander and said, Going my way? And you got in and we drove back to the firehouse in beatific silence, all -dwindled away to peace.” Beatty let Montags wrist go, let the hand slump limply on the table. “Alls well that is well in the end.”\n",
            "   Silence. Montag sat like a carved white stone. The echo of the final hammer on his skull died slowly away into the black cavern where Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And then when the startled dust had settled down about Montags mind, Faber began, softly, “All right, hes had his say. You must take it in. Ill say my say, too, in the  few hours. And youll take it in. And youll try to judge them and make your decision as to which way to jump, or fall. But I want it to be your decision, not mine, and not the Captains. But remember that the Captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority. We all have our harps to play. And its up to you now to know with which ear youll listen.”\n",
            "   Montag opened his mouth to answer Faber and was saved this error in the presence of others when the station bell rang. The alarm-voice in the ceiling chanted. There was a tacking-tacking sound as the alarm-report telephone typed out the address across the room. Captain Beatty, his poker cards in one pink hand, walked with exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the address when the report was finished. He glanced perfunctorily at it, and shoved it in his pocket. He came back and sat down. The others looked at him.\n",
            "   “It can wait exactly forty seconds while I take all the money away from you,” said Beatty, happily.\n",
            "   Montag put his cards down.\n",
            "   “Tired, Montag? Going out of this game?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “Hold on. Well, come to think of it, we can finish this hand later. Just leave your cards face down and hustle the equipment. On the double now.” And Beatty rose up again. “Montag, you dont look well? Id hate to think you were coming down with another fever...”\n",
            "   “Ill be all right.”\n",
            "   “Youll be fine. This is a special case. Come on, jump for it!”\n",
            "   They leaped into the air and clutched the brass pole as if it were the last vantage point above a tidal wave passing below, and then the brass pole, to their dismay slid them down into darkness, into the blast and cough and suction of the gaseous dragon roaring to life!\n",
            "   “Hey!”\n",
            "   They rounded a corner in thunder and siren, with concussion of tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank, like the food in the stomach of a giant; with Montags fingers jolting off the silver rail, swinging into cold space, with the wind tearing his hair back from his head, with the wind whistling in his teeth, and him all the while thinking of the women, the chaff women in his parlour tonight, with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and his silly damned reading of a book to them. How like trying to put out fires with water-pistols, how senseless and insane. One rage turned in for another. One anger displacing another. When would he stop being entirely mad and be quiet, be very quiet indeed?\n",
            "   “Here we go!”\n",
            "   Montag looked up. Beatty never drove, but he was driving tonight, slamming the Salamander around corners, leaning forward high on the drivers throne, his massive black slicker flapping out behind so that he seemed a great black bat flying above the engine, over the brass numbers, taking the full wind.\n",
            "   “Here we go to keep the world happy, Montag!”\n",
            "   Beattys pink, phosphorescent cheeks glimmered in the high darkness, and he was smiling furiously.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The Salamander boomed to a halt, throwing men off in slips and clumsy hops. Montag stood fixing his raw eyes to the cold bright rail under his clenched fingers.\n",
            "   I cant do it, he thought. How can I go at this new assignment, how can I go on burning things? I cant go in this place.\n",
            "   Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had rushed, was at Montags elbow. “All right, Montag?”\n",
            "   The men ran like cripples in their clumsy boots, as quietly as spiders.\n",
            "   At last Montag raised his eyes and turned. Beatty was watching his face.\n",
            "   “Something the matter, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Why,” said Montag slowly, “weve stopped in front of my house.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   \n",
            "PART III\n",
            "BURNING BRIGHT\n",
            "\n",
            "   LIGHTS flicked on and house-doors opened all down the street, to watch the carnival set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with dry satisfaction, the other with disbelief, at the house before them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “now you did it. Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that hes burnt his damn wings, he wonders why. Didnt I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?”\n",
            "   Montags face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place  door, set in its bright borders of flowers.\n",
            "   Beatty snorted. “Oh, no! You werent fooled by that little idiots routine, now, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! Its all in her file. Ill be damned. Ive hit the bullseye. Look at the sick look on your face. A few grass-blades and the quarters of the moon. What trash. What good did she ever do with all that?”\n",
            "   Montag sat on the cold fender of the Dragon, moving his head half an inch to the left, half an inch to the right, left, right, left right, left...\n",
            "   “She saw everything. She didnt do anything to anyone. She just let them alone.”\n",
            "   “Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didnt she? One of those damn do-gooders with their shocked, holier-than-thou silences, their one talent making others feel guilty. God damn, they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed!”\n",
            "   The front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, running, one suitcase held with a dream-like clenching rigidity in her fist, as a beetle-taxi hissed to the curb.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick.\n",
            "   “Mildred, you didnt put in the alarm!”\n",
            "   She shoved the valise in the waiting beetle, climbed in, and sat mumbling, “Poor family, poor family, oh everything gone, everything, everything gone now...”\n",
            "   Beatty grabbed Montags shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour, far down the street, gone.\n",
            "   There was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms. Montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him, to see Stoneman and Black wielding axes, shattering window-panes to provide cross-ventilation.\n",
            "   The brush of a deaths-head moth against a cold black screen. “Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What is happening\n",
            "   “This is happening to me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What a dreadful surprise,” said Beatty. “For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are. But lets not talk about them, eh? By the time the consequences catch up with you, its too late, isnt it, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Montag, can you get away, run?” asked Faber.\n",
            "   Montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses. Beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze.\n",
            "   “What is there about fire thats so lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” Beatty blew out the flame and lit it again. “Its perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or almost perpetual motion. If you let it go on, itd burn our lifetimes out. What is fire? Its a mystery. Scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules. But they dont really know. Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets too burdensome, then into the furnace with it. Now, Montag, youre a burden. And fire will lift you off my shoulders, clean, quick, sure; nothing to rot later. Antibiotic, aesthetic, practical.”\n",
            "   Montag stood looking in now at this queer house, made strange by the hour of the night, by murmuring neighbour voices, by littered glass, and there on the floor, their covers torn off and spilled out like swan-feathers, the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth bothering with, for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper, and ravelled binding.\n",
            "   Mildred, of course. She must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them back in. Mildred. Mildred.\n",
            "   “I want you to do this job all by your lonesome, Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your house, your clean-up.”\n",
            "   “Montag, cant you run, get away!”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Montag helplessly. “The Hound! Because of the Hound!”\n",
            "   Faber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was meant for him, heard. “Yes, the Hounds somewhere about the neighbourhood, so dont try anything. Ready?”\n",
            "   “Ready.” Montag snapped the safety-catch on the flamethrower.\n",
            "   “Fire!”\n",
            "   A great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall. He stepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering whisper, with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain. He burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything, the chairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the silverware and plastic dishes, everything that showed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him tomorrow, who had gone and quite forgotten him already, listening to her Seashell radio pour in on her and in on her as she rode across town, alone. And as before, it was good to burn, he felt himself gush out in the fire, snatch, rend, rip in half with flame, and put away the senseless problem. If there was no solution, well then now there was no problem, either. Fire was best for everything!\n",
            "   “The books, Montag!”\n",
            "   The books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers.\n",
            "   And then he came to the parlour where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white thoughts and their snowy dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the vacuum hissed out at him. The emptiness made an even emptier whistle, a senseless scream. He tried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed, but he could not. He held his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs. He cut off its terrible emptiness, drew back, and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning. The fire-proof plastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame.\n",
            "   “When youre quite finished,” said Beatty behind him. “Youre under arrest.”\n",
            "   The house fell in red coals and black ash. It bedded itself down in sleepy pink-grey cinders and a smoke plume blew over it, rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky. It was three-thirty in the morning. The crowd drew back into the houses; the great tents of the circus had slumped into charcoal and rubble and the show was well over.\n",
            "   Montag stood with the flame-thrower in his limp hands, great islands of perspiration drenching his armpits, his face smeared with soot. The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces illuminated faintly by the smouldering foundation.\n",
            "   Montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together.\n",
            "   “Was it my wife turned in the alarm?”\n",
            "   Beatty nodded. “But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I let ride. One way or the other, youd have got it. It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly damn snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks hes the Lord of all Creation. You think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger, youll drown!”\n",
            "   Montag could not move. A great earthquake had come with fire and levelled the house and Mildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move. The earthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there, his knees half-bent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage, letting Beatty hit him without raising a hand.\n",
            "   “Montag, you idiot, Montag, you damn fool; why did you really do it?”\n",
            "   Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was running with his mind, he was gone, leaving this dead soot-covered body to sway in front of another raving fool.\n",
            "   “Montag, get out of there!” said Faber.\n",
            "   Montag listened.\n",
            "   Beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back. The green bullet in which Fabers voice whispered and cried, fell to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He held it half in, half out of his ear.\n",
            "   Montag heard the distant voice calling, “Montag, you all right?”\n",
            "   Beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket. “Well—so theres more here than I thought. I saw you tilt your head, listening. First I thought you had a Seashell. But when you turned clever later, I wondered. Well trace this and drop it on your friend.”\n",
            "   “No!” said Montag.\n",
            "   He twitched the safety catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montags fingers and his eyes widened the faintest bit. Montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his hands to see what new thing they had done. Thinking back later he could never decide whether the hands or Beattys reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder. The last rolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears, not touching him.\n",
            "   Beatty grinned his most charming grin. “Well, thats one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. Whatll it be this time? Why dont you belch Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? ‘There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind, which I respect not!’ Hows that? Go ahead now, you second-hand litterateur, pull the trigger.” He took one step toward Montag.\n",
            "   Montag only said, “We never burned right...”\n",
            "   “Hand it over, Guy,” said Beatty with a fixed smile.\n",
            "   And then he was a shrieking blaze, a jumping, sprawling, gibbering mannikin, no longer human or known, all writhing flame on the lawn as Montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on him. There was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove, a bubbling and frothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction and a boiling over of yellow foam. Montag shut his eyes, shouted, shouted, and fought to get his hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and at last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent.\n",
            "   The other two firemen did not move.\n",
            "   Montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flame-thrower. “Turn around!”\n",
            "   They turned, their faces like blanched meat, streaming sweat; he beat their heads, knocking off their helmets and bringing them down on themselves. They fell and lay without moving.\n",
            "   The blowing of a single autumn leaf.\n",
            "   He turned and the Mechanical Hound was there.\n",
            "   It was half across the lawn, coming from the shadows, moving with such drifting ease that it was like a single solid cloud of black-grey smoke blown at him in silence.\n",
            "   It made a single last leap into the air, coming down at Montag from a good three feet over his head, its spidered legs reaching, the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth. Montag caught it with a bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten feet back against the bole of a tree, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it scrabble and seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the Hound up in the air, burst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour like a skyrocket fastened to the street. Montag lay watching the dead-alive thing fiddle the air and die. Even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now working through the flesh of his leg. He felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles an hour. He was afraid to\n",
            "   get up, afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all, with an anaesthetized leg. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness...\n",
            "   And now...?\n",
            "   The street empty, the house burnt like an ancient bit of stage-scenery, the other homes dark, the Hound here, Beatty there, the three other firemen another place, and the Salamander...? He gazed at the immense engine. That would have to go, too.\n",
            "   Well, he thought, lets see how badly off you are. On your feet now. Easy, easy... there.\n",
            "   He stood and he had only one leg. The other was like a chunk of burnt pine-log he was carrying along as a penance for some obscure sin. When he put his weight on it, a shower of silver needles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on, you, you cant stay here!\n",
            "   A few house-lights were going on again down the street, whether from the incidents just passed, or because of the abnormal silence following the fight, Montag did not know. He hobbled around the ruins, seizing at his bad leg when it lagged, talking and whimpering and shouting directions at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital. He heard a number of people crying out in the darkness and shouting. He reached the back yard and the alley. Beatty, he thought, youre not a problem now. You always said, dont face a problem, bum it. Well, now Ive done both. Good-bye, Captain.\n",
            "   And he stumbled along the alley in the dark.\n",
            "   A shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought, youre a fool, a damn fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful idiot, a damn idiot, and a fool, a damn fool; look at the mess and wheres the mop, look at the mess, and what do you do? Pride, damn it, and temper, and youve junked it all, at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself. But everything at once, but everything one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, everything. No excuse, though, no excuse. A fool, a damn fool, go give yourself up!\n",
            "   No, well save what we can, well do what there is left to do. If we have to burn, lets take a few more with us. Here!\n",
            "   He remembered the books and turned back. Just on the off chance.\n",
            "   He found a few books where he had left them, near the garden fence. Mildred, God bless her, had missed a few. Four books still lay hidden where he had put them. Voices were wailing in the night and flashbeams swirled about. Other Salamanders were roaring their engines far away, and police sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens.\n",
            "   Montag took the four remaining books and hopped, jolted, hopped his way down the alley and suddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there. Something inside had jerked him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay where he had fallen and sobbed, his legs folded, his face pressed blindly to the gravel.\n",
            "   Beatty wanted to die.\n",
            "   In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there, joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air. How strange, strange, to want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and staying alive, you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad, and then...\n",
            "   At a distance, running feet.\n",
            "   Montag sat up. Lets get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just cant sit! But he was still crying and that had to be finished. It was going away now. He hadnt wanted to kill anyone, not even Beatty. His flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He saw Beatty, a torch, not moving, fluttering out on the grass. He bit at his knuckles. Im sorry, Im sorry, oh God, sorry...\n",
            "   He tried to piece it all together, to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago before the sieve and the sand, Denhams Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and excursions, too much for a few short days, too much, indeed, for a lifetime.\n",
            "   Feet ran in the far end of the alley.\n",
            "   “Get up!” he told himself. “Damn it, get up!” he said to the leg, and stood. The pains were spikes driven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common, ordinary safety pins, and after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps, filling his hand with slivers from the board fence, the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg. And the leg was at last his own leg again. He had been afraid that running might break the loose ankle. Now, sucking all the night into his open mouth, and blowing it out pale, with all the blackness left heavily inside himself, he set out in a steady jogging pace. He carried the books in his hands.\n",
            "   He thought of Faber.\n",
            "   Faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now. He had burnt Faber, too. He felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt Faber was really dead, baked like a roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.\n",
            "   You must remember, burn them or theyll burn you, he thought. Right now its as simple as that.\n",
            "   He searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other pocket he found the usual Seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning.\n",
            "   “Police Alert. Wanted: Fugitive in city. Has committed murder and crimes against the State. Name: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. Last seen...”\n",
            "   He ran steadily for six blocks, in the alley, and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty thoroughfare ten lanes wide. It seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open. It was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him to run across, easily seen in the blazing illumination, easily caught, easily shot down.\n",
            "   The Seashell hummed in his ear.\n",
            "   “...watch for a man running...watch for the running man... watch for a man alone, on foot... watch...”\n",
            "   Montag pulled back into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas station, a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there, and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up. Now he must be clean and presentable if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly across that wide boulevard. It would give him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to get where...?\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, where am I running?\n",
            "   Nowhere. There was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really. Except Faber. And then he realized that he was indeed, running toward Fabers house, instinctively. But Faber couldnt hide him; it would be suicide even to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway, for a few short minutes. Fabers would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in his own ability to survive. He just wanted to know that there was a man like Faber in the world. He wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body. And some of the money must be left with Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on his way. Perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the highways, in the fields and hills.\n",
            "   A great whirling whisper made him look to the sky.\n",
            "   The police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head off a dry dandelion flower. Two dozen of them flurried, wavering, indecisive, three miles off, like butterflies puzzled by autumn, and then they were plummeting down to land, one by one, here, there, softly kneading the streets where, turned back to beetles, they shrieked along the boulevards or, as suddenly, leapt back into the sir, continuing their search.\n",
            "   And here was the gas station, its attendants busy now with customers. Approaching from the rear, Montag entered the mens washroom. Through the aluminium wall he heard a radio voice saying, “War has been declared.” The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines, the gas, the money owed. Montag stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing would happen. The war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file, an hour, two hours from now.\n",
            "   He washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry, making little sound. He came out of the washroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the edge of the empty boulevard.\n",
            "   There it lay, a game for him to win, a vast bowling alley in the cool morning. The boulevard was as clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims and certain unknown killers. The air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the warmth of Montags body alone; it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it. And now he must begin his little walk.\n",
            "   Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep breath. His lungs were like burning brooms in his chest. His mouth was sucked dry from running. His throat tasted of bloody iron and there was rusted steel in his feet.\n",
            "   What about those lights there? Once you started walking youd have to gauge how fast those beetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the other curb? It seemed like a hundred yards. Probably not a hundred, but figure for that anyway, figure that with him going very slowly, at a nice stroll, it might take as much as thirty seconds, forty seconds to walk all the way. The beetles? Once started, they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds. So, even if halfway across he started to run...?\n",
            "   He put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right. He walked on the empty avenue.\n",
            "   Even if the street were entirely empty, of course, you couldnt be sure of a safe crossing, for a car could appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had taken a dozen breaths.\n",
            "   He decided not to count his steps. He looked neither to left nor right. The light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot.\n",
            "   He listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right. Its movable headlights jerked back and forth suddenly, and caught at Montag.\n",
            "   Keep going.\n",
            "   Montag faltered, got a grip on the books, and forced himself not to freeze. Instinctively he took a few quick, running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again. He was now half across the street, but the roar from the beetles engines whined higher as it put on speed.\n",
            "   The police, of course. They see me. But slow now; slow, quiet, dont turn, dont look, dont seem concerned. Walk, thats it, walls, walk.\n",
            "   The beetle was rushing. The beetle was roaring. The beetle raised its speed. The beetle was whining. The beetle was in high thunder. The beetle came skimming. The beetle came in a single whistling trajectory, fired from an invisible rifle. It was up to 120 m. p. h. It was up to 130 at least. Montag clamped his jaws. The heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks, it seemed, and jittered his eye-lids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body.\n",
            "   He began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran. He put out his legs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and down and back. God! God! He dropped a book, broke pace, almost turned, changed his mind, plunged on, yelling in concrete emptiness, the beetle scuttling after its running food, two hundred, one hundred feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag gasping, flailing his hands, legs up down out, up down out, closer, closer, hooting, calling, his eyes burnt white now as his head jerked about to confront the flashing glare, now the beetle was swallowed in its own light, now it was nothing but a torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. Now-almost on top of him!\n",
            "   He stumbled and fell.\n",
            "   Im done! Its over!\n",
            "   But the falling made a difference. An instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and swerved out. It was gone. Montag lay flat, his head down. Wisps of laughter trailed back to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle.\n",
            "   His right hand was extended above him, flat. Across the extreme tip of his middle finger, he saw now as he lifted that hand, a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tyre had touched in passing. He looked at that black line with disbelief, getting to his feet.\n",
            "   That wasnt the police, he thought.\n",
            "   He looked down the boulevard. It was clear now. A carful of children, all ages, God knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling, yelling, hurrahing, had seen a man, a very extraordinary sight, a man strolling, a rarity, and simply said, “Lets get him,” not knowing he was the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a,number of children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours, their faces icy with wind, and coming home or not coming at dawn, alive or not alive, that made the adventure.\n",
            "   They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek. For no reason at all in the world they would have killed me.\n",
            "   He walked toward the far kerb telling each foot to go and keep going. Somehow he had picked up the spilled books; he didnt remember bending or touching them. He kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse?\n",
            "   He stopped and his mind said it again, very loud.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse!\n",
            "   He wanted to run after them yelling.\n",
            "   His eyes watered.\n",
            "   The thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that car, seeing Montag down, instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out. If Montag had remained an upright target...?\n",
            "   Montag gasped.\n",
            "   Far down the boulevard, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and was now racing back, slanting over on the wrong side of the street, picking up speed.\n",
            "   But Montag was gone, hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long journey, an hour or was it a minute, ago? He stood shivering in the night, looking back out as the beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue, whirling laughter in the air all about it, gone.\n",
            "   Further on, as Montag moved in darkness, he could see the helicopters falling, falling, like the first flakes of snow in the long winter. to come...\n",
            "   The house was silent.\n",
            "   Montag approached from the rear, creeping through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass. He touched the screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved across the porch, listening.\n",
            "   Mrs. Black, are you asleep in there? he thought. This isnt good, but your husband did it to others and never asked and never wondered and never worried. And now since youre a firemans wife, its your house and your turn, for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt without thinking..\n",
            "   The house did not reply.\n",
            "   He hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back and the house was still dark and quiet, sleeping.\n",
            "   On his way across town, with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky, he phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night. Then he stood in the cold night air, waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders coming, coming to bum Mr. Blacks house while he was away at work, to make his wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire. But now, she was still asleep.\n",
            "   Good night, Mrs. Black, he thought.—\n",
            "   “Faber!”\n",
            "   Another rap, a whisper, and a long waiting. Then, after a minute, a small light flickered inside Fabers small house. After another pause, the back door opened.\n",
            "   They stood looking at each other in the half-light, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in the others existence. Then Faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed Montag and moved him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were wailing off in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Ive been a fool all down the line. I cant stay long. Im on my way God knows where.”\n",
            "   “At least you were a fool about the right things,” said Faber. “I thought you were dead. The audio-capsule I gave you—”\n",
            "   “Burnt.”\n",
            "   “I heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing. I almost came out looking for you.”\n",
            "   “The captains dead. He found the audio-capsule, he heard your voice, he was going to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower.”\n",
            "   Faber sat down and did not speak for a time.\n",
            "   “My God, how did this happen?” said Montag. “It was only the other night everything was fine and the  thing I know Im drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I cant breathe. Theres Beatty dead, and he was my friend once, and theres Millie gone, I thought she was my wife, but now I dont know. And the house all burnt. And my job gone and myself on the run, and I planted a book in a firemans house on the way. Good Christ, the things Ive done in a single week!”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. It was coming on for a long time.”\n",
            "   “Yes, I believe that, if theres nothing else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could feel it for a long time, I was saving something up, I went around doing one thing and feeling another. God, it was all there. Its a wonder it didnt show on me, like fat. And now here I am, messing up your life. They might follow me here.”\n",
            "   “I feel alive for the first time in years,” said Faber. “I feel Im doing what I should have done a lifetime ago. For a little while Im not afraid. Maybe its because Im doing the right thing at last. Maybe its because Ive done a rash thing and dont want to look the coward to you. I suppose Ill have to do even more violent things, exposing myself so I wont fall down on the job and turn scared again. What are your plans?”\n",
            "   “To keep running.”\n",
            "   “You know the wars on?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   “God, isnt it funny?” said the old man. “It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.”\n",
            "   “I havent had time to think.” Montag drew out a hundred dollars. “I want this to stay with you, use it any way thatll help when Im gone.”\n",
            "   “But—”\n",
            "   “I might be dead by noon; use this.”\n",
            "   Faber nodded. “Youd better head for the river if you can, follow along it, and if you can hit the old railroad lines going out into the country, follow them. Even though practically everythings airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the rails are still there, rusting. Ive heard there are still hobo camps all across the country, here and there; walking camps they call them, and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled, they say theres lots of old Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are wanted and hunted in the cities. They survive, I guess. There arent many of them, and I guess the Governments never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down. You might hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in St. Louis, Im leaving on the five a. m. bus this morning, to see a retired printer there, Im getting out into the open myself, at last. The money will be put to good use. Thanks and God bless you. Do you want to sleep a few minutes?”\n",
            "   “Id better run.”\n",
            "   “Lets check.”\n",
            "   He took Montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside, revealing a television screen the size of a postal card. “I always wanted something very small, something I could talk to, something I could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary, nothing that could shout me down, nothing monstrous big. So, you see.” He snapped it on. “Montag,” the TV set said, and lit up. “M-O-N-T-A-G.” The name was spelled out by the voice. “Guy Montag. Still running. Police helicopters are up. A new Mechanical Hound has been brought from another district...”\n",
            "   Montag and Faber looked at each other.\n",
            "   “...Mechanical Hound never fails. Never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible invention made a mistake. Tonight, this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the Hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target...”\n",
            "   Faber poured two glasses of whisky. “Well need these.”\n",
            "   They drank.\n",
            "   “...nose so sensitive the Mechanical Hound can remember and identify ten thousand odour-indexes on ten thousand men without re-setting!”\n",
            "   Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house, at the walls, the door, the doorknob, and the chair where Montag now sat. Montag saw the look. They both looked quickly about the house and Montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the sweat of his hand hung from the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the jewels of a small chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about everything, he was a luminous cloud, a ghost that made breathing once more impossible. He saw Faber stop up his own breath for fear of drawing that ghost into his own body, perhaps, being contaminated with the phantom exhalations and odours of a running man.\n",
            "   “The Mechanical Hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the Burning!”\n",
            "   And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd, and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower.\n",
            "   So they must have their game out, thought Montag. The circus must go on, even with war beginning within the hour...\n",
            "   He watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed so remote and no part of him; it was a play apart and separate, wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. Thats all for me, you thought, thats all taking place just for me, by God.\n",
            "   If he wished, he could linger here, in comfort, and follow the entire hunt on through its swift. phases, down alleys across streets, over empty running avenues, crossing lots and playgrounds, with pauses here or there for the necessary commercials, up other alleys to the burning house of Mr. and Mrs. Black, and so on finally to this house with Faber and himself seated, drinking, while the Electric Hound snuffed down the last trail, silent as a drift of death itself, skidded to a halt outside that window there. Then, if he wished, Montag might rise, walk to the window, keep one eye on the TV screen, open the window, lean out, look back, and see himself dramatized, described, made over, standing there, limned in the bright small television screen from outside, a drama to be watched objectively, knowing that in other parlours he was large as life, in full colour, dimensionally perfect! And if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself, an instant before oblivion, being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlour-sitters who had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their living-room walls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man carnival.\n",
            "   Would he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty million people, mightnt he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would stay with them long after the. Hound had turned, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera remained stationary, watching the creature dwindle in the distance—a splendid fade-out! What could he say in a single word, a few words, that would sear all their faces and wake them up?\n",
            "   “There,” whispered Faber.\n",
            "   Out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine, not animal, not dead, not alive, glowing with a pale green luminosity. It stood near the smoking ruins of Montags house and the men brought his discarded flame-thrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the Hound. There was a whirring, clicking, humming.\n",
            "   Montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink. “Its time. Im sorry about this:”\n",
            "   “About what? Me? My house? I deserve everything. Run, for Gods sake. Perhaps I can delay them here—”\n",
            "   “Wait. Theres no use your being discovered. When I leave, burn the spread of this bed, that I touched. Burn the chair in the living room, in your wall incinerator. Wipe down the furniture with alcohol, wipe the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning on full in all the rooms and spray with moth-spray if you have it. Then, turn on your lawn sprinklers as high as theyll go and hose off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the trail in here, anyway..\n",
            "   Faber shook his hand. “Ill tend to it. Good luck. If were both in good health,  week, the week after, get in touch. General Delivery, St. Louis. Im sorry theres no way I can go with you this time, by ear-phone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I never thought I would use it. What a silly old man. No thought there. Stupid, stupid. So I havent another green bullet, the right kind, to put in your head. Go now!”\n",
            "   “One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, some old sneakers and socks...”\n",
            "   Faber was gone and back in a minute. They sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape. “To keep the ancient odour of Mr. Faber in, of course,” said Faber sweating at the job.\n",
            "   Montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky. “I dont want that Hound picking up two odours at once. May I take this whisky. Ill need it later. Christ I hope this works!”\n",
            "   They shook hands again and, going out of the door, they glanced at the TV. The Hound was on its way, followed by hovering helicopter cameras, silently, silently, sniffing the great night wind. It was running down the first alley.\n",
            "   “Good-bye!”\n",
            "   And Montag was out the back door lightly, running with the half-empty valise. Behind him he heard the lawn-sprinkling system jump up, filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then with a steady pour all about, washing on the sidewalks, and draining into the alley. He carried a few drops of this rain with him on his face. He thought he heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasnt certain.\n",
            "   He ran very fast away from the house, down toward the river.\n",
            "   Montag ran.\n",
            "   He could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and swift, like a wind that didnt stir grass, that didnt jar windows or disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Hound did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it, so you could feel the silence building up a pressure behind you all across town. Montag felt the pressure rising, and ran.\n",
            "   He stopped for breath, on his way to the river, to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened houses, and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlour walls and there on the walls the Mechanical Hound, a breath of neon vapour, spidered along, here and gone, here and gone! Now at Elm Terrace, Lincoln, Oak, Park, and up the alley toward Fabers house.\n",
            "   Go past, thought Montag, dont stop, go on, dont turn in!\n",
            "   On the parlour wall, Fabers house, with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air.\n",
            "   The Hound paused, quivering.\n",
            "   No! Montag held to the window sill. This way! Here!\n",
            "   The procaine needle flicked out and in, out and in. A single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell from the needle as it vanished in the Hounds muzzle.\n",
            "   Montag held his breath, like a doubled fist, in his chest.\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound turned and plunged away from Fabers house down the alley again.\n",
            "   Montag snapped his gaze to the sky. The helicopters were closer, a great blowing of insects to a single light source.\n",
            "   With an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.\n",
            "   He shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window, and the fascinating seance going on in there! Hell! and he was away and gone! The alley, a street, the alley, a street, and the smell of the river. Leg out, leg down, leg out and down. Twenty million Montags running, soon, if the cameras caught him. Twenty million Montags running, running like an ancient flickery Keystone Comedy, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had seen it a thousand times. Behind him now twenty million silently baying Hounds ricocheted across parlours, three-cushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall, gone, right wall, centre wall, left wall, gone!\n",
            "   Montag jammed his Seashell to his ear.\n",
            "   “Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the  minute looks from his house. Ready!”\n",
            "   Of course! Why hadnt they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadnt this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldnt be missed! The only man running alone in the night city, the only man proving his legs!\n",
            "   “At the count of ten now! One! Two!”\n",
            "   He felt the city rise. Three .\n",
            "   He felt the city turn to its thousands of doors.\n",
            "   Faster! Leg up, leg down!\n",
            "   “Four!”\n",
            "   The people sleepwalking in their hallways.\n",
            "   “Five!”\n",
            "   He felt their hands on the doorknobs!\n",
            "   The smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain. His throat was burnt rust and his eyes were wept dry with running. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last hundred yards.\n",
            "   “Six, seven, eight!”\n",
            "   The doorknobs turned on five thousand doors. “Nine!”\n",
            "   He ran out away from the last row of houses, on a slope leading down to a solid moving blackness. “Ten!”\n",
            "   The doors opened.\n",
            "   He imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards, into alleys, and into the sky, faces hid by curtains, pale, night-frightened faces, like grey animals peering from electric caves, faces with grey colourless eyes, grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb flesh of the face.\n",
            "   But he was at the river.\n",
            "   He touched it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin, splashed his body, arms, legs, and head with raw liquor; drank it and snuffed some up his nose. Then he dressed in Fabers old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river and watched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the dark.\n",
            "   He was three hundred yards downstream when the Hound reached the river. Overhead the great racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light fell upon the river and Montag dived under the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds. He felt the river pull him further on its way, into darkness. Then the lights switched back to the land, the helicopters swerved over the city again, as if they had picked up another trail. They were gone. The Hound was gone. Now there was only the cold river and Montag floating in a sudden peacefulness, away from the city and the lights and the chase, away from everything.\n",
            "   He felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors. He felt as if he had left the great seance and all the murmuring ghosts. He was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a reality that was unreal because it was new.\n",
            "   The black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.\n",
            "   He floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper. The river was very real; it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last, the leisure, to consider this month, this year, and a lifetime of years. He listened to his heart slow. His thoughts stopped rushing with his blood.\n",
            "   He saw the moon low in the sky now. The moon there, and the light of the moon caused by what? By the sun, of course. And what lights the sun? Its own fire. And the sun goes on, day after day, burning and burning. The sun and time. The sun and time and burning. Burning. The river bobbled him along gently. Burning. The sun and every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a single thing in his mind. After a long time of floating on the land and a short time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life.\n",
            "   The sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant. that everything burned!\n",
            "   One of them had to stop burning. The sun wouldnt, certainly. So it looked as if it had to be Montag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago. Somewhere the saving and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one way or another, in books, in records, in peoples heads, any way at all so long as it was safe, free from moths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and men with matches. The world was full of burning of all types and sizes. Now the guild of the asbestos-weaver must open shop very soon.\n",
            "   He felt his heel bump land, touch pebbles and rocks, scrape sand. The river had moved him toward shore.\n",
            "   He looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light, without shape, with only a size that went a thousand miles without wanting to stop, with its grass hills and forests that were waiting for him.\n",
            "   He hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water. He expected the Hound there. Suddenly the trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters.\n",
            "   But there was only the normal autumn wind high up, going by like another river. Why wasnt the Hound running? Why had the search veered inland? Montag listened. Nothing. Nothing.\n",
            "   Millie, he thought. All this country here. Listen to it! Nothing and nothing. So much silence, Millie, I wonder how youd take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad.\n",
            "   Millie was not here and the Hound was not here, but the dry smell of hay blowing from some distant field put Montag on the land. He remembered a farm he had visited when he was very young, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of unreality, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the tin moat of the city, cows chewed grass and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill.\n",
            "   Now, the dry smell of hay, the motion of the waters, made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a lonely barn away from the loud highways, behind a quiet farmhouse, and under an ancient windmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead. He lay in the high barn loft all night, listening to distant animals and insects and trees, the little motions and stirrings.\n",
            "   During the night, he thought, below the loft, he would hear a sound like feet moving, perhaps. He would tense and sit up. The sound would move away, He would lie back and look out of the loft window, very late in the night, and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself, until a very young and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to see her, but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now, so very long ago, the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin. Then, she would be gone from the warm window and appear again upstairs in her moon-whitened room. And then, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon, he would lie in the loft, hidden and safe, watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth, fleeing from the soft colour of dawn.\n",
            "   In the morning he would not have needed sleep, for all the warm odours and sights of a complete country night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth, when he thought to test it, was half a smile.\n",
            "   And there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, waiting for him, would be the incredible thing. He would step carefully down, in the pink light of early morning, so fully aware of the world that he would be afraid, and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it.\n",
            "   A cool glass of fresh milk, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps.\n",
            "   This was all he wanted now. Some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him the long time needed to think all the things that must be thought.\n",
            "   A glass of milk, an apple, a pear.\n",
            "   He stepped from the river.\n",
            "   The land rushed at him, a tidal wave. He was crushed by darkness and the look of the country and the million odours on a wind that iced his body. He fell back under the breaking curve of darkness and sound and smell, his ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over his sight like flaming meteors. He wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down somewhere. This dark land rising was like that day in his childhood, swimming, when from nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and green darkness, water burning mouth and nose, retching his stomach, screaming! Too much water!\n",
            "   Too much land!\n",
            "   Out of the black wall before him, a whisper. A shape. In the shape, two eyes. The night looking at him. The forest, seeing him.\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   After all the running and rushing and sweating it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work this hard, and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find...\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   Montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man.\n",
            "   The shape exploded away. The eyes vanished. The leafpiles flew up in a dry shower.\n",
            "   Montag was alone in the wilderness.\n",
            "   A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-like perfume mingled with blood and the gummed exhalation of the animals breath, all cardamon and moss and ragweed odour in this huge night where the trees ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the pulse of the heart behind his eyes.\n",
            "   There must have been a billion leaves on the land; he waded in them, a dry river smelling of hot cloves and warm dust. And the other smells! There was a smell like a cut potato from all the land, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. There was a smell like pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home. There was a faint yellow odour like mustard from a jar. There was a smell like carnations from the yard  door. He put down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him. His fingers smelled of liquorice.\n",
            "   He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was filled up with all the details of the land. He was not empty. There was more than enough here to fill him. There would always be more than enough.\n",
            "   He walked in the shallow tide of leaves, stumbling.\n",
            "   And in the middle of the strangeness, a familiarity.\n",
            "   His foot hit something that rang dully.\n",
            "   He moved his hand on the ground, a yard this way, a yard that.\n",
            "   The railroad track.\n",
            "   The track that came out of the city and rusted across the land, through forests and woods, deserted now, by the river.\n",
            "   Here was the path to wherever he was going. Here was the single familiar thing, the magic charm he might need a little while, to touch, to feel beneath his feet, as he moved on into the bramble bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the blowing down of leaves.\n",
            "   He walked on the track.\n",
            "   And he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove.\n",
            "   Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking now.\n",
            "   Half an hour later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware of his entire body, his face, his mouth, his eyes stuffed with blackness, his ears stuffed with sound, his legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he saw the fire ahead.\n",
            "   The fire was gone, then back again, like a winking eye. He stopped, afraid he might blow the fire out with a single breath. But the fire was there and he approached warily, from a long way off. It took the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it, and then he stood looking at it from cover. That small motion, the white and red colour, a strange fire because it meant a different thing to him.\n",
            "   It was not burning; it was warming!\n",
            "   He saw many hands held to its warmth, hands without arms, hidden in darkness. Above the hands, motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight. He hadnt known fire could look this way. He had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take. Even its smell was different.\n",
            "   How long he stood he did not know, but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing himself as an animal come from the forest, drawn by the fire. He was a thing of brush and liquid eye, of fur and muzzle and hoof, he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long long time, listening to the warm crackle of the flames.\n",
            "   There was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the mens faces, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn it over with the eyes, as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of steel these men were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the silence. Montag moved toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world.\n",
            "   And then the voices began and they were talking, and he could hear nothing of what the voices said, but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking at it; the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river. The voices talked of everything, there was nothing they could not talk about, he knew from the very cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them.\n",
            "   And then one of the men looked up and saw him, for the first or perhaps the seventh time, and a voice called to Montag:\n",
            "   “All right, you can come out now!”\n",
            "   Montag stepped back into the shadows.\n",
            "   “Its all right,” the voice said. “Youre welcome here.”\n",
            "   Montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits. He did not know what to say to them.\n",
            "   “Sit down,” said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group. “Have some coffee?”\n",
            "   He watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity. His lips were scalded, but that was good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat, and their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down again. Montag sipped. “Thanks,” he said. “Thanks very much.”\n",
            "   “Youre welcome, Montag. My names Granger.” He held out a small bottle of colourless fluid. “Drink this, too. Itll change the chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now youll smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the best thing is Bottoms up.”\n",
            "   Montag drank the bitter fluid.\n",
            "   “Youll stink like a bobcat, but thats all right,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “You know my name;” said Montag.\n",
            "   Granger nodded to a portable battery TV set by the fire.\n",
            "   “Weve watched the chase. Figured youd wind up south along the river. When we heard you plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk, we didnt hide as we usually do. We figured you were in the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city. Something funny there. The chase is still running. The other way, though.”\n",
            "   “The other way?”\n",
            "   “Lets have a look.”\n",
            "   Granger snapped the portable viewer on. The picture was a nightmare, condensed, easily passed from hand to hand, in the forest, all whirring colour and flight. A voice cried:\n",
            "   “The chase continues north in the city! Police helicopters are converging on Avenue 87 and Elm Grove Park!”\n",
            "   Granger nodded. “Theyre faking. You threw them off at the river. They cant admit it. They know they can hold their audience only so long. The shows got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So theyre sniffing for a scape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. Theyll catch Montag in the  five minutes!”\n",
            "   “But how—”\n",
            "   “Watch.”\n",
            "   The camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street.\n",
            "   “See that?” whispered Granger. “Itll be you; right up at the end of that street is our victim. See how our camera is coming in? Building the scene. Suspense. Long shot. Right now, some poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Dont think the police dont know the habits of queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia Anyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. Never know when that sort of information might be handy. And today, it turns out, its very usable indeed. It saves face. Oh, God, look there!”\n",
            "   The men at the fire bent forward.\n",
            "   On the screen, a man turned a corner. The Mechanical Hound rushed forward into the viewer, suddenly. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the man.\n",
            "   A voice cried, “Theres Montag! The search is done!”\n",
            "   The innocent man stood bewildered, a cigarette burning in his hand. He stared at the Hound, not knowing what it was. He probably never knew. He glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens. The cameras rushed down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victims face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target.\n",
            "   “Montag, dont move!” said a voice from the sky.\n",
            "   The camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him simultaneously. The victim was seized by Hound and camera in a great spidering, clenching grip. He screamed. He screamed. He screamed!\n",
            "   Blackout.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   Montag cried out in the silence and turned away.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   And then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces expressionless, an announcer on the dark screen said, “The search is over, Montag is dead; a crime against society has been avenged.”\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   “We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a half-hour of Just-Before-Dawn, a programme of-”\n",
            "   Granger turned it off.\n",
            "   “They didnt show the mans face in focus. Did you notice?\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Even your best friends couldnt tell if it was you. They scrambled it just enough to let the imagination take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen, trembling.\n",
            "   Granger touched Montags arm. “Welcome back from the dead.” Montag nodded. Granger went on. “You might as well know all of us, now. This is Fred Clement, former occupant of the Thomas Hardy chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Engineering School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U. C. L. A., a specialist in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for ethics, an ancient study now, for Columbia University quite some years ago. Reverend Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one Sunday and the  for his views. Hes been bumming with us some time now. Myself: I wrote a book called The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and Society, and here I am! Welcome, Montag!”\n",
            "   “I dont belong with you,” said Montag, at last, slowly. “Ive been an idiot all the way.”\n",
            "   “Were used to that. We all made the right kind of mistakes, or we wouldnt be here. When we were separate individuals, all we had was rage. I struck a fireman when he came to burn my library years ago. Ive been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “What have you to offer?”\n",
            "   “Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Revelation, but I havent even that now.”\n",
            "   “The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. Where was it?”\n",
            "   “Here,” Montag touched his head.\n",
            "   “Ah,” Granger smiled and nodded.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong? Isnt that all right?” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Better than all right; perfect!” Granger turned to the Reverend. “Do we have a Book of Ecclesiastes?”\n",
            "   “One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” Granger took Montags shoulder firmly. “Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important youve become in the last minute!”\n",
            "   “But Ive forgotten!”\n",
            "   “No, nothings ever lost. We have ways to shake down your clinkers for you.”\n",
            "   “But Ive tried to remember!”\n",
            "   “Dont try. Itll come when we need it. All of us have photographic memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now weve got the method down to where we can recall anything thats been read once. Would you like, some day, Montag, to read Platos Republic?”\n",
            "   “Of course!”\n",
            "   “I am Platos Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons is Marcus.”\n",
            "   “How do you do?” said Mr. Simmons.\n",
            "   “Hello,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political book, Gullivers Travels! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and-this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and this one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.”\n",
            "   Everyone laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “It cant be,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “It is,” replied Granger, smiling.” Were book-burners, too. We read the books and burnt them, afraid theyd be found. Micro-filming didnt pay off; we were always travelling, we didnt want to bury the film and come back later. Always the chance of discovery. Better to keep it in the old heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and pieces of history and literature and international law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, its here. And the hour is late. And the wars begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a thousand colours. What do you think, Montag?”\n",
            "   “I think I was blind trying to do things my way, planting books in firemens houses and sending in alarms.”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully. But our way is simpler and, we think, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need, intact and safe. Were not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are destroyed, the knowledge is dead, perhaps for good. We are model citizens, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the city people let us be. Were stopped and searched occasionally, but theres nothing on our persons to incriminate us. The organization is flexible, very loose, and fragmentary. Some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and fingerprints. Right now we have a horrible job; were waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end. Its not pleasant, but then were not in control, were the odd minority crying in the wilderness. When the wars over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world.”\n",
            "   “Do you really think theyll listen then?”\n",
            "   “If not, well just have to wait. Well pass the books on to our children, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course.\n",
            "   But you cant make people listen. They have to come round in their own time, wondering what happened and why the world blew up under them. It cant last.”\n",
            "   “How many of you are there?”\n",
            "   “Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, bums on the outside, libraries inside. It wasnt planned, at first. Each man had a book he wanted to remember, and did. Then, over a period of twenty years or so, we met each other, travelling, and got the loose network together and set out a plan. The most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not important, we mustnt be pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world. Were nothing more than dust-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise. Some of us live in small towns. Chapter One of Thoreaus Walden in Green River, Chapter Two in Willow Farm, Maine. Why, theres one town in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bombll ever touch that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And when the wars over, some day, some year, the books can be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what they know and well set it up in type until another Dark Age, when we might have to do the whole damn thing over again. But thats the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing.”\n",
            "   “What do we do tonight?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Wait,” said Granger. “And move downstream a little way, just in case.”\n",
            "   He began throwing dust and dirt on the fire.\n",
            "   The other men helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the wilderness, the men all moved their hands, putting out the fire together.\n",
            "   They stood by the river in the starlight.\n",
            "   Montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. Five. Five oclock in the morning. Another year ticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river.\n",
            "   “Why do you trust me?” said Montag.\n",
            "   A man moved in the darkness.\n",
            "   “The look of yous enough. You havent seen yourself in a mirror lately. Beyond that, the city has never cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses in their heads cant touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone knows it. So long as the vast population doesnt wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the Constitution, its all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities dont bother us. And you look like hell.”\n",
            "   They moved along the bank of the river, going south. Montag tried to see the mens faces, the old faces he remembered from the firelight, lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perhaps he had expected their faces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried, to glow as lanterns glow, with the light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these men had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race, searched a long search, seen good things destroyed, and now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the lamps. They werent at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every future dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the customers who might come by in later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers.\n",
            "   Montag squinted from one face to another as they walked.\n",
            "   “Dont judge a book by its cover,” someone said.\n",
            "   And they all laughed quietly, moving downstream.\n",
            "   There was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up. Montag stared back at the city, far down the river, only a faint glow now.\n",
            "   “My wifes back there.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry to hear that. The cities wont do well in the  few days,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “Its strange, I dont miss her, its strange I dont feel much of anything,” said Montag. “Even if she dies, I realized a moment ago, I dont think Ill feel sad. It isnt right. Something must be wrong with me.”\n",
            "   “Listen,” said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind man who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slum in our town; and he made toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his hands. And when he died, I suddenly realized I wasnt crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. Ive never gotten over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands. He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten million fine actions the night he passed on.”\n",
            "   Montag walked in silence. “Millie, Millie,” he whispered. “Millie.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I cant remember anything. I think of her hands but I dont see them doing anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or theres a cigarette in them, but thats all.”\n",
            "   Montag turned and glanced back.\n",
            "   What did you give to the city, Montag?\n",
            "   Ashes.\n",
            "   What did the others give to each other?\n",
            "   Nothingness.\n",
            "   Granger stood looking back with Montag. “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, youre there. It doesnt matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”\n",
            "   Granger moved his hand. “My grandfather showed me some V-2 rocket films once, fifty years ago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb mushroom from two hundred miles up? Its a pinprick, its nothing. With the wilderness all around it.\n",
            "   “My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people that were allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back what it has given, as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so big. When we forget how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be. You see?” Granger turned to Montag. “Grandfathers been dead for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by God, in the convolutions of my brain youd find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me. As I said earlier, he was a sculptor. ‘I hate a Roman named Status Quo!’ he said to me. ‘Stuff your eyes with wonder,’ he said, ‘live as if youd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. Its more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,’ he said, ‘shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.’”\n",
            "   “Look!” cried Montag.\n",
            "   And the war began and ended in that instant.\n",
            "   Later, the men around Montag could not say if they had really seen anything. Perhaps the merest flourish of light and motion in the sky. Perhaps the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles, one mile up, for the merest instant, like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand, and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning city they had left behind. The bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished, once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour; as quick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a full three seconds, all of the time in history, before the bombs struck, the enemy ships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander might not believe because they were invisible; yet the heart is suddenly shattered, the body falls in separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air; the brain squanders its few precious memories and, puzzled, dies.\n",
            "   This was not to be believed. It was merely a gesture. Montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist over the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, disintegrate, leave no stone on another, perish. Die.\n",
            "   Montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. “Run!” he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, “Run!” To Mildred, “Get out, get out of there!” But Clarisse, he remembered, was dead. And Faber was out; there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five a. m. bus was on its way from one desolation to another. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man could make it. Before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway, its destination would be meaningless, and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard.\n",
            "   And Mildred...\n",
            "   Get out, run!\n",
            "   He saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her building. He saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of colour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her, where the family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a half-inch, now a quarter-inch from the top of the hotel. Leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, nervously, as if to plunge, drop, fall into that swarming immensity of colour to drown in its bright happiness.\n",
            "   The first bomb struck.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Perhaps, who would ever know? Perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of colour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion.\n",
            "   Montag, falling flat, going down, saw or felt, or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in Millies face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own face reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of itself, that at last she recognized it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way.\n",
            "   I remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago. Chicago, a long time ago. Millie and I. Thats where we met! I remember now. Chicago. A long time ago.\n",
            "   The concussion knocked the air across and down the river, turned the men over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in lifting sprays, and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn with a great wind passing away south. Montag crushed himself down, squeezing himself small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant saw the city, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For another of those impossible instants the city stood, rebuilt and unrecognizable, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had built it, erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a reversed avalanche, a million colours, a million oddities, a door where a window should be, a top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell down dead.\n",
            "   Montag, lying there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth, gasping and crying, now thought again, I remember, I remember, I remember something else. What is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it, quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off, before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to himself silently, lying flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denhams Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Preacher by himself, standing there in his mind, looking at him...\n",
            "   “There,” said a voice.\n",
            "   The men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass. They held to the earth as children hold to familiar things, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from bursting, to keep their sanity from bursting, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed.\n",
            "   Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And lying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now. Silence fell down in the sifting dust, and all the leisure they might need to look around, to gather the reality of this day into their senses.\n",
            "   Montag looked at the river. Well go on the river. He looked at the old railroad tracks. Or well go that way. Or well walk on the highways now, and well have time to put things into ourselves. And some day, after it sets in us a long time, itll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a lot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. Well just start walking today and see the world and the way the world walks around and talks, the way it really looks. I want to see everything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a while itll all gather together inside and itll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where its finally me, where its in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I get hold of it so itll never run off. Ill hold on to the world tight some day. Ive got one finger on it now; thats a beginning.\n",
            "   The wind died.\n",
            "   The other men lay a while, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and begin the days obligations, its fires and foods, its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They lay blinking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then slow...\n",
            "   Montag sat up.\n",
            "   He did not move any further, however. The other men did likewise. The sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain.\n",
            "   Silently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the river to look upstream.\n",
            "   “Its flat,” he said, a long time later. “City looks like a heap of baking-powder. Its gone.” And a long time after that. “I wonder how many knew it was coming? I wonder how many were surprised?”\n",
            "   And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a thousand?\n",
            "   Someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet and sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly, with nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down.\n",
            "   Granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. “Well have a bite. Then well turn around and walk upstream. Theyll be needing us up that way.”\n",
            "   Someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it and the frying-pan was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this ritual silently.\n",
            "   Granger looked into the fire. “Phoenix.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ: every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like were doing the same thing, over and over, but weve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things weve done for a thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day well stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember, every generation.”\n",
            "   He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully.\n",
            "   “Now, lets get on upstream,” said Granger. “And hold on to one thought: Youre not important. Youre not anything. Some day the load were carrying with us may help someone. But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didnt use what we got out of them. We went right on insulting the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. Were going to meet a lot of lonely people in the  week and the  month and the  year. And when they ask us what were doing, you can say, Were remembering. Thats where well win out in the long run. And some day well remember so much that well build the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up. Come on now, were going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the  year and take a long look in them.”\n",
            "   They finished eating and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been given more wick. In the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down.\n",
            "   Montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him, going north. He was surprised, and moved aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of hay, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going until he caught up with the people.\n",
            "   But now there was a long mornings walk until noon, and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things they remembered, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them. Montag felt the slow stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else? Something, something...\n",
            "   And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n",

            "   As you can see, Gustav Von Seyfertitz was a most unusual mine specialist. Mine? Yes. Our problems are land mines in our heads. Step on them! Shock-troop therapy, he once called it, searching for words. “Blitzkrieg?” I offered.\n",

            "   I almost heard the torpedo leave its tube. “Fire two!” he said.\n",

            "   Von Seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye, raked at an angle, glared at me. It had an uncanny resemblance, in its glassy coldness, his own fierce hawks gaze.\n",
            "   His voice, from behind the periscope, echoed. “So you want to know, eh, how Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, suffered to leave the cold ocean depths, depart his dear North Sea ship, flee his destroyed and beaten fatherland, to become the Unterderseaboat Doktor—”\n",
            "   “Now that you mention—”\n",

            "   His heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me: a bright, thin monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg. I winced. For now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with cold fire.\n",
            "   “Why the monocle?” I said.\n",
            "   “Idiot! It is to cover my good eye so that neither there eye can see and my intuition is free to work!”\n",
            "   “Oh,” I said.\n",
            "   And he began his monologue. And as he talked I realized his need had been pent up, capped, years, so he talked on and on, forgetting me.\n",
            "   And it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred. I rose slowly to my feet as Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz circled, his long, slim cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air, which read like white Rorschach blots.\n",
            "   With each implantation of his foot, a word ca out, and then another, in a sort of plodding grammar. Sometimes he stopped and stood poised with one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his tongue and examined. Then the shoe went down, the noun slid forth and the verb and object in good time.\n",
            "   Until at last, circling, I found myself in a chair stunned, for I saw:\n",
            "   Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz stretched on his couch, his long spider fingers laced on his chest.\n",
            "   “It has been no easy thing to come forth on land,” he sibilated. “Some days I was the jellyfish, frozen. Others, the shore-strewn octopi, at least with tentacles, or the crayfish sucked back into my skull. But I have built my spine, year on year, and now I walk among the land men and survive.”\n",
            "   He paused to take a trembling breath, then continued:\n",
            "   “I moved in stages from the depths to a houseboat, to a wharf bungalow, to a shore-tent and then back to a canal in a city and at last to New York an island surrounded by water, eh? But where, where, in all this, I wondered, would a submarine commander find his place, his work, his mad love and activity?\n",
            "   “It was one afternoon in a building with the worlds longest elevator that it struck me like a hand grenade in the ganglion. Going down, down, down, other people crushed around me, and the numbers descending and the floors whizzing by the glass windows, rushing by flicker-flash, flicker-flash, conscious, subconscious, id, ego-id, life, death, lust, kill, lust, dark, light, plummeting, falling, ninety, eighty, fifty, lower depths, high exhilaration, id, ego, id, until this shout blazed from my raw throat in a great all-accepting, panic-manic shriek:\n",
            "   “Dive! Dive!”\n",
            "   “I remember,” I said.\n",
            "   “Dive!” I screamed so loudly that my fellow passengers, in shock, peed merrily. Among stunned faces, I stepped out of the lift to find one-sixteenth of an inch of pee on the floor. “Have a nice day!” I said, jubilant with self-discovery, then ran to self-employment, to hang a shingle and  my periscope, carried from the mutilated, divested, castrated unterderseaboat all these years. Too stupid to see in it my psychological future and my final downfall, my beautiful artifact, the brass genitalia of psychotic research, the Von Seyfertitz Mark Nine Periscope!”\n",
            "   “Thats quite a story,” I said.\n",
            "   “Damn right,” snorted the alienist, eyes shut.\n",
            "   “And more than half of it true. Did you listen? What have you learned?”\n",
            "   “That more submarine captains should become psychiatrists.”\n",
            "   “So? I have often wondered: did Nemo really die when his submarine was destroyed? Or did he run off to become my great-grandfather and were his psychological bacteria passed along until I came into the world, thinking to command the ghostlike mechanisms that haunt the under tides, to wind up with the fifty-minute vaudeville routine in this sad, psychotic city?”\n",
            "   I got up and touched the fabulous brass symbol that hung like a scientific stalactite in mid-ceiling.\n",
            "   “May I look?”\n",
            "   “I wouldnt if I were you.” He only half heard me, lying in the midst of his depression as in a dark cloud.\n",

            "   “But a good cigar is a smoke.”\n",
            "   I remembered Sigmund Freuds quote about cigars, laughed, and touched the periscope again.\n",
            "   “Dont!” he said.\n",
            "   “Well, you dont actually use this for anything, do you? Its just a remembrance of your past, from your last sub, yes?”\n",
            "   “You think that?” He sighed. “Look!”\n",
            "   I hesitated, then pasted one eye to the viewer, shut the other, and cried:\n",
            "   “Oh, Jesus!”\n",
            "   “I warned you!” said Von Seyfertitz.\n",
            "   For they were there.\n",
            "   Enough nightmares to paper a thousand cinema screens. Enough phantoms to haunt ten thousand castle walls. Enough panics to shake forty cities into ruin.\n",

            "   The first psychological kaleidoscope in history.\n",
            "   And in the instant another thought came: how much of that stuff in there is me? Or Von Seyfertitz? Or both? Are these strange shapes my maundering daymares, sneezed out in the past weeks? When I talked, eyes shut, did my mouth spray invisible founts of small beasts which, caught in the periscope chambers, grew outsize? Like the microscopic photos of those germs that hide in eyebrows and pores, magnified a million times to become elephants on Scientific American covers? Are these images from other lost souls trapped on that couch and caught in the submarine device, or leftovers from my eyelashes and psyche?\n",
            "   “Its worth millions!” I cried. “Do you know what this is!?”\n",

            "   “Nuts,” I said. “Youre bored. I could get you a five-million-dollar deal with Amalgamated Fruit-cakes Inc. And the Sigmund F. Dreamboats, split three ways!”\n",
            "   “You dont understand,” said Von Seyfertitz. “I am keeping myself busy, busy, so I wont remember all the people I torpedoed, sank, drowned mid-Atlantic in 1944. I am not in the Amalgamated Fruitcake Cinema business. I only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails, cleaning earwax, and erasing inkblots from odd bean-bags like you. If I stop, I will fly apart. That periscope contains all and everything I have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans, cashews, and almonds. By staring at them I lose my own terrible life lost in the tides. If you won my periscope in some shoddy fly-by-night Hollywood strip poker, I would sink three times in my waterbed, never to be seen again. Have I shown you my waterbed? Three times as large as any pool. I do eighty laps asleep each night. Some-times forty when I catnap noons. To answer your million fold offer, no.”\n",

            "   “My God!” he shouted.\n",
            "   Too late, he was realizing he had let me step into his mind and life. Now he was on his feet between me and the periscope, staring at it and me, as if we were both terrors.\n",

            "   It was as if he had slipped a devil mask over his face. His eyes grew wide. His mouth gaped.\n",
            "   I examined his face and saw murder. I sidled toward the door.\n",
            "   “You wouldnt say anything to anyone?” he said.\n",
            "   “No”\n",

            "   “I was afraid of that!”\n",
            "   I reached the elevator first and by a miracle it flung wide its doors when I banged the Down button. I jumped in.\n",
            "   “Say good-bye!” cried Von Seyfertitz, raising his fist as if it held a bomb.\n",
            "   “Good-bye!” I said. The doors slammed.\n",
            "   I did not see Von Seyfertitz again for a year.\n",

His Grand Slam will be recalled at centurys end: appearances on Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey, and Gerarldo in one single cyclonic afternoon, with interchangeable hyperboles, positive-negative-positive every hour. There were Von Seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine periscope sold at the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. With the super inducement of a half-million dollars, he force-fed and easily sold a bad book. Duplicates of the animalcules, lurks, and curious critters trapped in his brass viewer arose in pop-up coloring books, paste-on tattoos, and inkpad rubberstamp nightmares at Beasts-R-Us.\n",
            "   I had hoped that all this would cause him to forgive and forget. No.\n",
            "   One noon a year and a month later, my doorbell rang and there stood Gustav Von Seyfertitz, F Baron Woldstein, tears streaming down his cheeks.\n",

            "   must have been seventy people strung out between the elevator and the Barons door, waiting with copies of books by Madame Blavatsky, Krishna murti, and Shirley MacLaine under their arms. There was a roar like a suddenly opened furnace door when they saw the Baron. We beat it on the double and got inside his office before anyone could surge to follow.\n",
            "   “See what you have done to me!” Von Seyfertitz pointed.\n",
            "   The office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling. The desk was from Napoleons age an exquisite Empire piece worth at least fifty thousand dollars. The couch was the best soft leather I had ever seen, and the two pictures on the wall were originals-a Renoir and a Monet. My God, millions! I thought.\n",
            "   “Okay,” I said. “The beasts, you said. Youll kill them, not me?”\n",
            "   The old man wiped his eyes with the back of one hand, then made a fist.\n",
            "   “Yes!” he cried, stepping up to the fine periscope, which reflected his face, madly distorted, in its elongated shape. “Like this. Thus and so!”\n",
            "   And before I could prevent, he gave the brass machine a terrific slap with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another, with both fists, cursing. Then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of a spoiled child and throttled and shook it.\n",
            "   I cannot say what I heard in that instant. Perhaps real sounds, perhaps imagined temblors, like a glacier\n",
            "   cracking in the spring, or icicles in mid-night. Perhaps it was a sound like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in folds of tissue. Maybe I thought I heard a vast breath in sucked, a cloud dissolving up inside itself. Or did I sense clock machineries spun so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass snowflakes?\n",
            "   I put my eye to the periscope.\n",
            "   I looked in upon—\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",
            "   It was just a brass tube with some crystal lenses and a view of an empty couch.\n",
            "   No more.\n",
            "   I seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an unimaginable horizon.\n",
            "   But the couch remained only a couch, and the wall beyond looked back at me with its great blank face.\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to fall on one rusted fist.\n",
            "   “Are they dead?” he whispered.\n",
            "   “Gone.”\n",
            "   “Good, they deserved to die. Now I can return to some kind of normal, sane world.”\n",
            "   And with each word his voice fell deeper within his throat, his chest, his soul, until it, like the vaporous haunts within the peri-kaleidoscope, melted into silence.\n",
            "   He clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp\n",
            "   of prayer, like one who beseeches God to deliver him from plagues. And whether he was once again praying for my death, eyes shut, or whether he simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device, I could not say.\n",
            "   I only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing. Me and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this incredible captain from beneath Nemos tidal seas.\n",
            "   “Gone,” murmured Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, whispered for the last time. “Gone.”\n",
            "   That was almost the end.\n",
            "   I went around a month later. The landlord reluctantly let me look over the premises, mostly because I hinted that I might be renting.\n",
            "   We stood in the middle of the empty room where I could see the dent marks where the couch had once stood.\n",
            "   I looked up at the ceiling. It was empty.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said the landlord. “Didnt they fix it so you cant see? Damn fool Baron made a damn big hole up into the office above. Rented that, too, but never used it for anything I knew of. There was just that big damn hole he left when he went away.”\n",
            "   I sighed with relief.\n",

            "   But now the true collision loomed.\n",
            "   One night over a ham omelet with a bottle of cheap red and the conversation loping quietly, leaning on the card table and promising each other grander and more ebullient futures, Maggie suddenly said, “I feel faint.”\n",

The machines, the dustbusters and can openers around the apartment, had names, as did various parts of their anatomy, revealed to no one.\n",
            "   So Sascha, as an entity, a presence growing toward friendship, was not unusual. And when he actually began to speak up, they were not surprised. The gentle demands of their marriage, with love as currency instead of cash, made it inevitable.\n",

            "   They spoke on that and a dozen score of things late at night. When hyperventilating about life, they propped themselves up on their pillows as if the future might happen right now. They waited, anticipating, in seance, for the silent small offspring to speak his first words before dawn.\n",
            "   “I love our lives,” said Maggie, lying there, “all the games. I hope it never stops. Youre not like other men, who drink beer and talk poker. Dear God, I wonder, how many other marriages play like us?”\n",

            "   “No one could be moving in at this hour of the night, could they?” asked Bella of the darkness, the window, and herself.\n",

            "   How come I know upright? she thought. I only heard. But-yes, upright! Not only that, but inside a box!\n",
            "   She turned slowly and as she went back up the steps, one by one, slowly, slowly, the voices began to sound again, below, as if, disturbed, they had waited for her to go away.\n",
            "   “What are you doing?” demanded one voice.\n",

            "   “Yes!” Bella closed her eyes and swallowed hard and half fell to sit on the steps, getting her breath back as black-and-White pictures flashed in her head. Suddenly it was 1929 and she Was very small, in a theater with dark and light pictures looming above the first row where she sat, transfixed, and then laughing, and then transfixed and laughing again.\n",

            "   “Chaplin did, Langdon did, Harold Lloyd, sure.”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy, did they use lots of locations?”\n",
            "   “Palms, they used Palms lots, Culver City Main Street,” Effie Street.”\n",
            "   “Effie Street!”\n",

            "   “Did you say Effie Street?”\n",
            "   “Sure, and God, its three in the morning!”\n",

            "   “Sure, Zelda, sure! Oh, God, Zelda, if you could see, hear, what I hear!”\n",
            "   Zelda was suddenly wide awake on the line. “Whats going on? You serious?”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, yes. On the steps just now, and last night and the night before maybe, I heard, I hear—two men hauling a—a piano up the hill.”\n",
            "   “Someones pulling your leg!”\n",
            "   “No, no, theyre there. I go out and theres nothing. But the steps are haunted, Zelda! One voice says: “Heres another fine mess youve got us in. “You got to hear that mans voice!”\n",
            "   “Youre drunk and doing this because you know Im a nut for them.”\n",
            "   “No, no. Come, Zelda. Listen. Tell!”\n",
            "   Maybe half an hour later, Bella heard the old tin lizzie rattle up the alley behind the apartments. It was a car Zelda, in her joy at visiting silent-movie theaters, had bought to lug herself around in while she wrote about the past, always the past, and steaming into Cecil B. DeMilles old place or circling Harold Lloyds nation-state, or cranking and banging around the Universal backlot, paying her respects to the Phantoms opera stage, or sitting on Ma and Pa Kettles porch chewing a sandwich lunch. That was Zelda, who once wrote in a silent country in a silent time for Silver Screen.\n",
            "   Zelda lumbered across the front porch, a huge body with legs as big as the Bernini columns in front of St. Peters in Rome, and a face like a harvest moon.\n",
            "   On that round face now was suspicion, cynicism, skepticisms, in equal pie-parts. But when she saw Bellas pale stare she cried:\n",
            "   “Belle!”\n",
            "   “You see Im not lying!” said Bella.\n",
            "   “I see!”\n",
            "   “Keep your voice down, Zelda. Oh, its scary and strange, terrible and nice. So come on.”\n",
            "   And the two women edged along the walk to the rim of the old hill near the old steps in old Hollywood, and suddenly as they moved they felt time take a half turn around them and it was another year, because nothing had changed all the buildings were the way they were in 1928 and the hills beyond like they were in 1926 and the steps, just the, way they were when the cement was poured in 1921.\n",
            "   “Listen, Zelda. There!”\n",
            "   And Zelda listened and at first there was only a creaking of wheels down in the dark, like crickets, and then a moan of wood and a hum of piano strings, and then one voice lamenting about this job, and the other voice claiming he had nothing to do with it, and then the thumps as two derby hats fell, and an exasperated voice announced:\n",
            "   “Heres another fine mess youve got us in.”\n",
            "   Zelda, stunned, almost toppled off the hill. She held tight to Bellas arm as tears brimmed in her eyes.\n",
            "   “Its a trick. Someones got a tape recorder or—”\n",
            "   “No, I checked. Nothing but the steps, Zelda, the steps!”\n",
            "   Tears rolled down Zeldas plump cheeks.\n",
            "   “Oh, God, that is his voice! Im the expert, Im the mad, fanatic, Bella. Thats Ollie. And that other voice, Stan! And youre not nuts after all!”\n",
            "   The voices below rose and fell and one cried: “Why dont you do something to help me?”\n",
            "   Zelda moaned. “Oh, God, its so beautiful.”\n",
            "   “What does it mean?” asked Bella. “Why are they here? Are they really ghosts, and why would ghosts climb this hill every night, pushing that music box, night after night, tell me, Zelda, why?”\n",
            "   Zelda peered down the hill and shut her eyes for a moment to think. “Why do any ghosts go anywhere? Retribution? Revenge? No, not those two. Love maybes the reason, lost loves or something Yes?”\n",
            "   Bella let her heart pound once or twice and then said, “Maybe nobody told them.”\n",
            "   “Told them what?”\n",
            "   “Or maybe they were told a lot but still didnt believe, because maybe in their old years things got bad, I mean they were sick, and sometimes when youre sick you forget.”\n",
            "   “Forget what!?”\n",
            "   “How much we loved them.”\n",
            "   “They knew!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Did they? Sure, we told each other, but maybe not enough of us ever wrote or waved when they passed and just yelled “Love!” you think?”\n",
            "   “Hell, Bella, theyre on TV every night!”\n",
            "   “Yeah, but that dont count. Has anyone, since they left us, come here to these steps and said? Maybe those voices down there, ghosts or whatever, have been here every night for years, pushing that music box, and nobody thought, or tried, to just whisper or yell all the love we had all the years. Why not?”\n",
            "   “Why not?” Zelda stared down into the long darkness where perhaps shadows moved and maybe a piano lurched clumsily among the shadows. “Youre right.”\n",
            "   If Im right,” said Bella, “and you say so, theres only one thing to do—”\n",
            "   “You mean you and me?”\n",
            "   “Who else? Quiet. Come on.”\n",
            "   They moved down a step. In the same instant lights came on around them, in a window here, another there. A screen door opened somewhere and angry words shot out into the night:\n",
            "   “Hey, whats going on?”\n",
            "   “Pipe down!”\n",
            "   “You know what time it is?” “My God,” Bella whispered, “everyone else hears now!”\n",
            "   “No, no.” Zelda looked around wildly. “Theyll spoil everything!”\n",
            "   “Im calling the cops!” A window slammed.\n",
            "   “God,” said Bella, “if the cops come—”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Itll be all wrong. If anyones going to tell them to take it easy, pipe down, its gotta be us. We care, dont we?”\n",
            "   “God, yes, but—”\n",
            "   “No buts. Grab on. Here we go.”\n",
            "   The two voices murmured below and the piano tuned itself with hiccups of sound as they edged down another step and another, their mouths dry, hearts hammering, and the night so dark they could see only the faint streetlight at the stair bottom, the single street illumination so far away it was sad being there all by itself, waiting for shadows to move.\n",
            "   More windows slammed up, more screen doors opened. At any moment there would be an avalanche of protest, incredible outcries, perhaps shots fired, and all this gone forever.\n",
            "   Thinking this, the women trembled and held tight, as if to pummel each other to speak against the rage.\n",
            "   “Say something, Zelda, quick.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Anything! Theyll get hurt if we dont—”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know what I mean. Save them.”\n",
            "   “Okay. Jesus!” Zelda froze, clamped her eyes shut to find the words, then opened her eyes and said, “Hello.”\n",
            "   “Louder.”\n",
            "   “Hello,” Zelda called softly, then loudly.\n",
            "   Shapes rustled in the dark below. One of the voices rose while the other fell and the piano strummed its hidden harp strings.\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called\n",
            "   “Thats good. Go on.”\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called, braver now. “Dont listen to those others yelling. We wont hurt you. Its just us. Im Zelda, you wouldnt remember, and this here is Bella, and weve known you forever, or since we were kids, and we love you. Its late, but we thought you should know. Weve loved you ever since you were in the desert or on that boat with ghosts or trying to sell Christmas trees door-to-door or in that traffic where you tore the headlights off cars, and we still love you, right, Bella?”\n",
            "   The night below was darkness, waiting.\n",
            "   Zelda punched Bellas arm.\n",
            "   “Yes!” Bella cried, “what she said. We love you.”\n",
            "   “We cant think of anything else to say.”\n",
            "   “But its enough, yes?” Bella leaned forward anxiously. “Its enough?”\n",
            "   A night wind stirred the leaves and grass around the stairs and the shadows below that had stopped moving with the music box suspended between them as they looked up and up at the two women, who suddenly began to cry. First tears fell from Bellas cheeks, and when Zelda sensed them, she let fall her own.\n",
            "   “So now,” said Zelda, amazed that she could form words but managed to speak anyway, “we want you to know, you don t have to come back anymore. You dont have to climb\n",
            "   the hill every night, waiting. For what we said just now is it, isnt it? I mean you wanted to hear it here on this hill, with those steps, and that piano, yes, thats the whole thing, it had to be that, didnt it? So now here we are and there you are and its said. So rest, dear friends.”\n",
            "   “Oh, there, Ollie,” added Bella in a sad, sad whisper. “Oh, Stan, Stanley.”\n",
            "   The piano, hidden in the dark, softly hummed its wires and creaked its ancient wood.\n",
            "   And then the most incredible thing happened. There was: a series of shouts and then a huge banging crash as the music box, in the dark, rocketed down the hill, skittering on the steps, playing chords where it hit, swerving, rushing, and ahead of it, running, the two shapes pursued by the musical beast, yelling, tripping, shouting, warning the Fates, crying out to the gods, down and down, forty, sixty, eighty, one hundred steps.\n",
            "   And half down the steps, hearing, feeling, shouting, crying themselves, and now laughing and holding to each other, the two women alone in the night wildly clutching, grasping, trying to see, almost sure that they did see, the three things ricocheting off and away, the two shadows rushing, one fat,, one thin, and the piano blundering after, discordant and mindless, until they reached the street, where, instantly, the one overhead streetlamp died as if struck, and the shadows floundered on, pursued by the musical beast.\n",
            "   And the two women, abandoned, looked down, exhausted with laughing until they wept and weeping until they laughed, until suddenly Zelda got a terrible look on her face as if shot.\n",
            "   “My God!” she shouted in panic, reaching out. “Wait. We didnt mean, we dont want-dont go forever! Sure, go. so the neighbors here sleep. But once a year, you hear? Once a year, one night a year from tonight, and every year after that, come back. It shouldnt bother anyone so much. But we got to tell you all over again, huh? Come back and bring the box with you, and well be here waiting, wont we, Bella?”\n",
            "   “Waiting, yes.”\n",
            "   There was a long silence from the steps leading down into an old black-and-white, silent Los Angeles.\n",
            "   “You think they heard?”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   And from somewhere far off and down, there was the faintest explosion like the engine of an old jalopy knocking itself to life, and then the merest whisper of a lunatic music from a dark theater when they were very young. It faded.\n",
            "   After a long while they climbed back up the steps, dabbing at their eyes with wet Kleenex. Then they turned for a final time to stare down into the night.\n",
            "   “You know something?” said Zelda. “I think they heard.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "THE ELECTROCUTION\n",
            "   \n",
            "   She let him tie the black silk over her eyes and he knotted it and jerked it so tight that she gasped and said, “Loosen it, damn you, Johnny, loosen it, or I wont go on!”?\n",
            "   “Sure,” he said easily, and she smelled his sharp breath; while beyond; the crowd rustled against the rope barrier and the carnival tent flapped in the night wind, and off, there was a drift of calliope music and the rattle of a trap drum.\n",
            "   Dimly, through the black silk, she could see the men, the boys, the few women, a good crowd, paying out dimes to see her strapped in this electric chair, the electrodes on her wrists and neck, waiting.\n",
            "   “There.” Johnnys voice whispered through the blindfold. “That better?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but her hands gripped the ends of the wooden chair. She felt her pulse beating in her arms and neck... Outside the pitchman yelled through his small cardboard megaphone and slapped his cane across the banner where Electras portrait shivered in the wind: yellow hair, hard blue eyes, sharp chin, seated in her death-chair like Someone come for tea.\n",
            "   With the black silk blinding her, it was easier to let her mind run back to wherever it wanted to go...\n",
            "   The carnival was either setting up in a new town or letting go; its brown tents inhaling by day, exhaling its stale air by night as the canvases slid rustling down along the dark poles. And then?\n",
            "   Last Monday night this young man with the long arms and the eager pink face bought three tickets to the sideshow and stood watching Electra three times as the electricity burned through her like blue fire while this young man strained at the rope barrier, and memorized her every move as she sat high up there on the platform, all fire and pale flesh.\n",
            "   He came four nights in a row.\n",
            "   “You got an audience, Ellie,” said Johnny on the third night.\n",
            "   “So I see,” she said.\n",
            "   “Dont pay no attention,” said Johnny.\n",
            "   “I wont,” she said. “Why should I? Dont worry.”\n",
            "   After all, shed done the act for years. Johnny slammed on the power, and it filled her from ankle to elbows to ears as he handed her the bright sword and she thrust it out blindly over the audience, smiling under her half mask, to let them tap shoulders and brows as the blue sparks crackled and spat. On the fourth night she shoved the sword far out toward the young man with the sweating pink face, first among the crowd. The young man raised his hand swiftly, eagerly, as if to seize the blade. Blue sparks leaped the gap, but his hand didnt flinch or stop as he grabbed on and took the fire in his fingers and then his fist and then his wrist and his arm into his body.\n",
            "   His eyes, in the light, flared with blue alcohol flame, fed by the sword, whose fire in passing lit her arm and face and body. He stretched his hand still farther out, his waist jammed against the rope, silent and tense. Then Johnny cried, “Everybody touch it! Every one!” And Electra lifted the blade out on the air for others to feel and stroke, while Johnny cursed. Through the blindfold she saw the terrible illumination which would not leave the young mans face.\n",
            "   The fifth night, instead of touching the young mans fingers, she tapped the blazing tip of the sword against the palm of his hand, brushing and burning until he shut his eyes.\n",
            "   That night she walked out on the lake pier after the show and did not look back as she moved, but listened and began to smile. The lake shook against the rotting piles. The carnival lights made wandering, uneasy roads on the black water. The Ferris wheel whirled high and around, with its faint screams, and far away the calliope steamed and sobbed “Beautiful Ohio.” She slowed her walking. She put out her right foot, slowly, then her left, then she stopped and turned her head. And as she turned she saw the shadow, and his arms moved around her. A long time later she leaned back in his arms and stared up into his healthy, excited pink face, and said, “My God, youre more dangerous than my chair!”\n",
            "   “Is your name really Electra?” he said.\n",
            "   The  night as the power leaped through her, she stiffened, shuddered, and clamped her lips in her teeth, moaning. Her legs stirred; her hands groped and scratched the chair arms.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong!” Beyond the blindfold, Johnny cried out, “What?”\n",
            "   And cut the power.\n",
            "   “Im all right,” she gasped. The crowd murmured. “Its nothing Go on! Now!”\n",
            "   And he hit the switch.\n",
            "   The fire crawled through her and again she clenched her teeth and threw her head back against the chair. A face rushed out of the dark, and a body with it, to press against her. The power exploded. The electric chair stopped, then melted.\n",
            "   Johnny, a million miles off in the dark, handed her the sword. Her limp, twitching hand dropped it. He handed it back and instinctively she shoved it far out into the night.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Someone, out there in the roaring darkness, touched the blade. She could imagine his eyes burning there, his lips parted as the power jolted him. He was pressed against the rope, hard, hard against the rope, and could not breathe or cry out or pull back!\n",
            "   The power died. The smell of lightning stayed.\n",
            "   “Thats it!” someone cried.\n",
            "   Johnny left her to squirm out of the leather straps, jumped off the low platform, and walked out toward the midway. Convulsively, she tore off the bonds, trembling. She ran from the tent, not looking back to see if the young man was still there against the rope.\n",
            "   She fell upon the cot of the trailer behind the tent, perspiring and shaking, and was still crying when Johnny stepped in to look down at her.\n",
            "   “Whats the matter?” he said.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing, Johnny.”\n",
            "   “What was that you pulled out there just now?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing.”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing,” he said. “Like hell it is.” His face twisted. “Like hell! You havent done anything like that for years!”\n",
            "   “I was nervous!”\n",
            "   “Years its been,” he said. “When we were first married you did that. You think I forgot how when I switched the power on this same happened like tonight? You been sitting in that chair for three years like someone listening to a radio. And tonight, and tonight!” he cried, choking, standing over her, his fists tightened. “Damn it, tonight.”\n",
            "   “Please, please, Johnny. I was nervous.”\n",
            "   “What were you thinking there in the chair?” he demanded, leaning down wildly. “What did you think about?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, Johnny, nothing. “He grabbed her hair. “Please!”\n",
            "   He threw her head down, turned, walked out, and stopped outside. “I know what you were thinking,” he said. “I know.” And she heard his footsteps fade away.\n",
            "   And the night passed and the day and another night with another crowd.\n",
            "   But nowhere in the crowd did she see his face. Now, in the blackness, with the blindfold tight to her face, she sat in the electric chair and waited while Johnny described the wonders of the Skeleton Man over on the  platform, and still she waited and stared at everyone who entered the tent. Johnny walked around the Skeleton Man, all stiffness, describing the living skull and the terrible bones, and at last the crowd rustled, turned, led by Johnny, his voice like a battered brass horn as he jumped up onto the platform with her so violently that she jerked aside and licked her red lips.\n",
            "   And now the knot of the blindfold was tied tighter and yet tighter as he bent to whisper:\n",
            "   “Miss him?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but held her head up. The crowd stirred below, like animals in a straw stable.\n",
            "   “Hes not here,” he whispered and locked the electrodes on her arms. She was silent. He whispered again, “Hell never come back.” He fitted the black skullcap over her hair. She trembled. “Afraid?” he wondered quietly. “What of?” He snapped the straps around her ankles. “Dont be afraid. Good clean electricity.” A gasp escaped her lips. He stood up. “I hit him,” he said softly, touching her blindfold. “Hit him so hard I broke his front teeth. Then I knocked him against a wall and hit him again and again—” He Stopped and shouted. “Ladies and gentlemen, witness the most astounding act in carnival history! Here you see a penitentiary electric chair exactly like those used in our biggest prisons. Perfect for the destruction of criminals!” With this last word she fell forward, fingers scratching the wood as he cried, “Before your very eyes, this dear lady will be electrocuted!”\n",
            "   The crowd murmured, and she thought of the tesla transformer under the platform and how Johnny might have fixed it so she got amperage, not voltage. Accident, bad accident Shame. Amperage, not voltage.\n",
            "   She wrenched her right hand free of its leather strap and heard the power switch slam shut as the blue fire seized and shook her, screaming!\n",
            "   The audience applauded and whistled and stomped. Oh she thought wildly, this is good, my death? Great! More applause! More screams!\n",
            "   Out of the black spaces a body fell. “Hit him so hard broke his teeth!” The body jerked. “Then I hit him and hit him again!” The body fell, was picked up, fell again. She screamed high and long as a million unseen mouths stung and bit her. Blue flames seized her heart. The young man” body writhed and exploded in bone shrapnel, flame, and ash\n",
            "   Calmly, Johnny handed her the sword.\n",
            "   “Now,” he said.\n",
            "   Being safe was like a blow to the stomach.\n",
            "   She sobbed, fumbling at the sword, quivering and jerking unable to move. The power hummed and the crowd stuck out their hands, some like spiders, some like birds leaping away wherever the sword sizzled and spat.\n",
            "   The power still lived in her bones as all over the carnival grounds the lights dimmed.\n",
            "   Click. The switch lay in its Off bed.\n",
            "   She sank in upon herself, the sweat running around her nose and her sagging mouth. Gasping, she fought free to pull the blindfold away.\n",
            "   The crowd had gone off to another platform, another miracle, where the Fat Lady called and they obeyed.\n",
            "   Johnnys hand lay on the switch. He dropped his hand, stood there watching her, his dark eyes cold, not flickering.\n",
            "   The tent lights looked dirty, old, yellow, and unclean. She stared blindly at the retreating crowd, Johnny, the tent, the lights. She looked shrunken in the chair. Half of her had poured out through the wires, flushed into the copper cable that fled over the town, leaping from high pole to pole. She lifted her head as if it weighed ninety pounds. The clean light had come, entered into and slid through her, and blasted out again; but it was not the same light anymore. She had changed it; she saw how she had made it. And she shivered because the light was discolored.\n",
            "   Johnnys mouth opened. She didnt hear him at first. He had to repeat what had to be said.\n",
            "   “Youre dead,” he said firmly. And again: “Youre dead.”\n",
            "   And sitting there in the electric chair, trapped by the leather straps, with a wind from the tent flaps playing over her face, evaporating the wetness, staring at him and seeing the dark in his eyes, she gave the only answer it was possible to give.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said, eyes shut. “Oh, yes. I am.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "HOPSCOTCH\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Vinia woke to the sound of a rabbit running down and across an endless moonlit field; but it was only the soft, quick beating of her heart. She lay on the bed for a moment, getting her breath. Now the sound of the running faded and was gone at a great distance. At last she sat up and looked down from her second-story bedroom window and there below, on the long sidewalk, in the faint moonlight before dawn, was the hopscotch.\n",
            "   Late yesterday, some child had chalked it out, immense and endlessly augmented, square upon square, line after line, numeral following numeral. You could not see the end of it. Down the street it built its crazy pattern, 3, 4, 5, on up to 10, then 30, 50, 90, on away to turn far corners. Never in all the childrens world a hopscotch like this! You could Jump forever toward the horizon.\n",
            "   Now in the very early, very quiet morning, her eyes traveled and jumped, paused and hopped, along that presumptuous ladder of chalk-scratches and she heard herself whisper:\n",
            "   “Sixteen.”\n",
            "   But she did not run on from there.\n",
            "   The  square waited, she knew, with the scribbled blue chalk 17, but her mind flung out its arms and balanced, teetering, poised with her numb foot planted across the 1 and the 6, and could go no further.\n",
            "   Trembling, she lay back down.\n",
            "   The room was like the bottom of a cool well all night and she lay in it like a white stone in a well, enjoying it, floating in the dark yet clear element of half dreams and half wakening. She felt the breath move in small jets from her nostrils and she felt the immense sweep of her eyelids shutting and opening again and again. And at last she felt the fever brought into her room by the presence of the sun beyond the hills.\n",
            "   Morning, she thought. It might be a special day. After all, its my birthday. Anything might happen. And I hope it does.\n",
            "   The air moved the white curtains like a summer breath.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   A voice was calling. But it couldnt be a voice. Yet-Vinia raised herself-there it was again.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   She slipped from bed and ran to the window of her high second-story window.\n",
            "   There on the fresh lawn below, calling up to her in the early hour, stood James Conway, no older than she, seventeen, very seriously smiling, waving his hand now as her head appeared.\n",
            "   “Jim, whatre you doing here?” she said, and thought, Does he know what day this is?\n",
            "   “Ive been up an hour already,” he replied. “Im going for a walk, starting early, all day. Want to come along?”\n",
            "   Oh but I couldnt... my folks wont be back till late tonight, Im alone, Im supposed to stay...”\n",
            "   She saw the green hills beyond the town and the roads leading out into summer, leading out into August and rivers and places beyond this town and this house and this room and this particular moment.\n",
            "   “I cant go...” she said faintly.\n",
            "   “I cant hear you!” he protested mildly, smiling up at her under a shielding hand.\n",
            "   “Why did you ask me to walk with you, and not someone else?”\n",
            "   He considered this for a moment. “I dont know,” he admitted. He thought it over again, and gave her his most pleasant and agreeable look. “Because, thats all, just because.”\n",
            "   “Ill be down,” she said.\n",
            "   “Hey!” he said.\n",
            "   But the window was empty.\n",
            "   They stood in the center of the perfect, jeweled lawn, over which one set of prints, hers, had run, leaving marks, and another, his, had walked in great slow strides to meet them. The town was silent as a stopped clock. All the shades were still down.\n",
            "   “My gosh,” said Vinia, “its early. Its crazy-early. Ive never been up this early and out this early in years. Listen to everyone sleeping.”\n",
            "   They listened to the trees and the whiteness of the houses in this early whispering hour, the hour when mice went back to sleep and flowers began untightening their bright fists.\n",
            "   “Which way do we go?”\n",
            "   “Pick a direction.”\n",
            "   Vinia closed her eyes, whirled, and pointed blindly. “Which way am I pointing?”\n",
            "   “North.”\n",
            "   She opened her eyes. “Lefts go north out of town, then. I dont suppose we should.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   And they walked out of town as the sun rose above the hills and the grass burned greener on the lawns.\n",
            "   There was a smell of hot chalk highway, of dust and sky and waters flowing in a creek the color of grapes. The sun was a new lemon. The forest lay ahead with shadows stirring like a million birds under each tree, each bird a leaf-darkness, trembling. At noon, Vinia and James Conway had crossed vast meadows that sounded brisk and starched underfoot. The day had grown warm, as an iced glass of tea grows warm, the frost burning off, left in the sun.\n",
            "   They picked a handful of grapes from a wild barbed-wire vine. Holding them up to the sun, you could see the clear grape thoughts suspended in the dark amber fluid, the little hot seeds of contemplation stored from many afternoons of solitude and plant philosophy. The grapes tasted of fresh, clear water and something that they had saved from the morning dews and the evening rains. They were the warmed-over flesh of April ready now, in August, to pass on their simple gain to any passing stranger. And the lesson was this; sit in the sun, head down, within a prickly vine, in flickery light or open light, and the world will come to you. The sky will come in its time, bringing rain, and the earth will rise through you, from beneath, and make you rich and make you full.\n",
            "   “Have a grape,” said James Conway. “Have two.”\n",
            "   They munched their wet, full mouths.\n",
            "   They sat on the edge of a brook and took off their shoes and let the water cut their feet off to the ankles with an exquisite cold razor.\n",
            "   My feet are gone! thought Vinia. But when she looked, there they were, underwater, living comfortably apart from her, completely acclimated to an amphibious existence.\n",
            "   They ate egg sandwiches Jim had brought with him in a paper sack.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” said Jim, looking at his sandwich before he bit it. “would you mind if I kissed you?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said, after a moment. “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Will you think it over?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Did we come on this picnic just so you could kiss me?” she asked suddenly.\n",
            "   “Oh, dont get me wrong! Its been a swell day! I dont want to spoil it. But if you should decide, later, that its all right for me to kiss you, would you tell me?”\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” she said, starting on her second sandwich, “if I ever decide.”\n",
            "   The rain came as a cool surprise.\n",
            "   It smelled of soda water and limes and oranges and the cleanest, freshest river in the world, made of snow-water, falling from the high, parched sky.\n",
            "   First there had been a motion, as of veils, in the sky. The clouds had enveloped each other softly. A faint breeze had lifted Vinias hair, sighing and evaporating the moisture from her upper lip, and then, as she and Jim began to run, the raindrops fell down all about without touching them and then at last began to touch them, coolly, as they leaped green-moss logs and darted among vast trees into the deepest, muskiest cavern of the forest. The forest sprang up in wet murmurs overhead, every leaf ringing and painted fresh with water.\n",
            "   “This way!” cried Jim.\n",
            "   And they reached a hollow tree so vast that they could squeeze in and be warmly cozy from the rain. They stood together, arms about each other, the first coldness from the rain making them shiver, raindrops on their noses and cheeks, laughing. “Hey!” He gave her brow a lick. “Drinking water!”\n",
            "   “Jim!”\n",
            "   They listened to the rain, the soft envelopment of the world in the velvet clearness of falling water, the whispers in deep grass, evoking odors of old, wet wood and leaves that had lain a hundred years, moldering and sweet.\n",
            "   Then they heard another sound. Above and inside the hollow warm darkness of the tree was a constant humming, like someone in a kitchen, far away, baking and crusting pies contentedly, dipping in sweet sugars and snowing in baking powders, someone in a warm, dim, summer-rainy kitchen making a vast supply of food, happy at it, humming between lips over it.\n",
            "   “Bees, Jim, up there! Bees!”\n",
            "   “Shh!”\n",
            "   Up the channel of moist, warm hollow they saw little yellow flickers. Now the last bees, wettened, were hurrying home from whatever pasture or meadow or field they had covered, dipping by Vinia and Jim, vanishing up the warm flue of summer into hollow dark.\n",
            "   “They wont bother us. Just stand still.”\n",
            "   Jim tightened his arms; Vinia tightened hers. She could smell his breath with the wild tart grapes still on it. And the harder the rain drummed on the tree, the tighter they held, laughing, at last quietly letting their laughter drain away into the sound of the bees home from the far fields. And for a moment, Vinia thought that she and Jim might be caught by a sudden drop of great masses of honey from above, sealing them into this tree forever, enchanted, in amber, to be seen by anyone in the  thousand years who strolled by, while the weather of all ages rained and thundered and turned green outside the tree.\n",
            "   It was so warm, so safe, so protected here, the world did not exist, there was raining silence, in the sunless, forested day.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” whispered Jim, after a while. “May I now?”\n",
            "   His face was very large, near her, larger than any face she had ever seen.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said.\n",
            "   He kissed her.\n",
            "   The rain poured hard on the tree for a full minute while everything was cold outside and everything was tree-warmth and hidden away inside.\n",
            "   It was a very sweet kiss. It was very friendly and comfortably warm and it tasted like apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you rise at night and walk into a dark, warm summer kitchen and drink from a cool tin cup. She had never imagined that a kiss could be so sweet and immensely tender and careful of her. He held her not as he had held her a moment before, hard, to protect her from the green rain weather, but he held her now as if she were a porcelain clock, very carefully and with consideration. His eyes were closed and the lashes were glistening dark; she saw this in the instant she opened her eyes and closed them again.\n",
            "   The rain stopped.\n",
            "   It was a moment before the new silence shocked them into an awareness of the climate beyond their world. Now there was nothing but the suspension of water in all the intricate branches of the forest. Clouds moved away to show the blue sky in great quilted patches.\n",
            "   They looked out at the change with some dismay. They waited for the rain to come back, to keep them, by necessity, in this hollow tree for another minute or an hour. But the sun appeared, shining through upon everything, making the scene quite commonplace again.\n",
            "   They stepped from the hollow tree slowly and stood with their hands out, balancing, finding their way, it seemed, in these woods where the water was drying fast on every limb and leaf.\n",
            "   “I think wed better start walking,” said Vinia. “That way.”\n",
            "   They walked off into the summer afternoon.\n",
            "   They crossed the town limits at sunset and walked hand in hand in the last glowing of the summer day. They had talked very little the rest of the afternoon, and now as they turned down one street after another, they looked at the passing sidewalk under their feet.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” he said at last. “Do you think this is the beginning of something?”\n",
            "   “Oh, gosh, Jim, I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Do you think maybe were in love?”\n",
            "   “Oh, I dont know that either!”\n",
            "   They passed down into the ravine and over the bridge and up the other side to her street.\n",
            "   “Do you think well ever be married?”\n",
            "   “Its too early to tell, isnt it?” she said.\n",
            "   “I guess youre right.” He bit his lip. “Will we go walking again soon?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont know. Lets wait and see, Jim.”\n",
            "   The house was dark, her parents not home yet. They stood on her porch and she shook his hand gravely.\n",
            "   “Thanks, Jim, for a really fine day,” she said.\n",
            "   “Youre welcome,” he said.\n",
            "   They stood there.\n",
            "   Then he turned and walked down the steps and across the dark lawn. At the far edge of lawn he stopped in the shadows and said, “Good night.”\n",
            "   He was almost out of sight, running, when she, in turn, said good night.\n",
            "   In the middle of the night, a sound wakened her.\n",
            "   She half sat up in bed, trying to hear it again. The folks were home, everything was locked and secure, but it hadnt been them. No, this was a special sound. And lying there, looking out at the summer night that had, not long ago, been a summer day, she heard the sound again, and it was a sound of hollowing warmth and moist bark and empty, tunneled tree, the rain outside but comfortable dryness and secretness inside, and it was the sound of bees come home from distant fields, moving upward in the flue of summer into wonderful darkness.\n",
            "   And this sound, she realized, putting her hand up in the summer-night room to touch it, was coming from her drowsy, half-smiling mouth.\n",
            "   Which made her sit bolt upright, and very quietly move downstairs, out through the door, onto the porch, and across the wet-grass lawn to the sidewalk, where the crazed hopscotch chalked itself way off into the future.\n",
            "   Her bare feet hit the first numbers, leaving moist prints up to 10 and 12, thumping, until she stopped at 16, staring down at 17, hesitating, swaying. Then she gritted her teeth, made fists, reared back, and...\n",
            "   Jumped right in the middle of the square 17.\n",
            "   She stood there for a long moment, eyes shut, seeing how it felt.\n",
            "   Then she ran upstairs and lay out on the bed and touched her mouth to see if a summer afternoon was breathing out of it, and listening for that drowsy hum, the golden sound, and it was there.\n",
            "   And it was this sound, eventually, which sang her to sleep.\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "THE FINNEGAN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   To say that I have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair Finnegan is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final melancholy. Only now, at threescore and ten, can I write these words for an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to unearth my truths or bury my lies.\n",
            "   The facts are these:\n",
            "   Three children went astray and were missed. Their bodies were found in the midst of Chatham Forest and each bore no marks of criminal assassination, but all had suffered their lifeblood to be drained. Only their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes withered by sunlight and no rain.\n",
            "   From the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites. Such myths always pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks. It could only have been a tombyard beast, it was said, that fed on and destroyed three lives and ruined three dozen more.\n",
            "   The children were buried in the most holy ground. Soon after, Sir Robert Merriweather, pretender to the throne of Sherlock Holmes but modestly refusing the claim, moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life. With myself, I might add, to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest.\n",
            "   Sir Robert Merriweather, you say?\n",
            "   Just that. Plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his shut-up house.\n",
            "   Were the doors used? Not one in nine. How had they appeared in Sir Roberts old manse? He had shipped them in, as a collector of doors, from Rio, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, and mid-America. Once collected, he had stashed them, hinged, to be seen from both sides, on the walls of his upper and lower chambers. There he conducted tours of these odd portals for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously overdone, the undersimplified, the rococo, or some First Empire cast aside by Napoleons nephews or seized from Hermann Goering, who had in turn ransacked the Louvre. Others, pelted by Oklahoma dust storms, were jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals buried in the windblown desolations of 1936 America. Name your least favorite door, it was his. Name the best quality, he owned it also, hidden and safe, true beauties behind oblivions portals.\n",
            "   I had come to see his doors, not the deaths. At his behest, which was a command, I had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to find Sir Robert involved not with ten dozen doors, but some great dark door. A mysterious portal, still un-found. And beneath? A tomb.\n",
            "   Sir Robert hurried the grand tour, opening and shutting panels rescued from Peking, long buried near Etna, or filched from Nantucket. But his heart, gone sick, was not in this, what should have been delightful, tour.\n",
            "   He described the spring rains that drenched the country to make things green, only to have people to walk out in that fine weather and one week find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his neck, and in the  weeks, the bodies of the two girls. People shouted for the police and sat drinking in pubs, their faces long and pale, while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the dooms that lay in Chatham Forest.\n",
            "   “Will you come with me,” said Sir Robert at last, “on a very strange, sad picnic?”\n",
            "   “I will,” I said.\n",
            "   So we snapped ourselves in weather-proofs, lugged a hamper of sandwiches and red wine, and plunged into the forest on a drear Sunday.\n",
            "   There was time, as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the trees, to recall what the papers had said about the vanished childrens bloodless flesh, the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times, clueless, while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drum-tight at sunset.\n",
            "   “Rain. Damn. Rain!” Sir Roberts pale face stared up, his gray mustache quivering over his thin mouth. He was sick and brittle and old. “Our picnic will be ruined!”\n",
            "   “Picnic?” I said. “Will our killer join us for eats?”\n",
            "   “I pray to God he will,” Sir Robert said. “Yes, pray to God he will.”\n",
            "   We walked through a land that was now mists, now dim sunlight, now forest, now open glade, until we came into a silent part of the woods, a silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the green moss lay in swards and hillocks. Spring had not yet filled the empty trees. The sun was like an arctic disk, withdrawn, cold, and almost dead.\n",
            "   “This is the place,” said Sir Robert at last.\n",
            "   “Where the children were found?” I inquired.\n",
            "   “Their bodies empty as empty can be.”\n",
            "   I looked at the glade and thought of the children and the people who had stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to whisper and touch and go away, lost.\n",
            "   “The murderer was never apprehended?”\n",
            "   “Not this clever fellow. How observant are you?” asked Sir Robert.\n",
            "   “What do you want observed?”\n",
            "   “Theres the catch. The police slipped up. They were stupidly anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess, seeking a killer with two arms, two legs, a suit of clothes, and a knife. So hypnotized with their human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious unbelievable fact about this place. So!”\n",
            "   He gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth.\n",
            "   Something happened. I stared at the ground. “Do that again,” I whispered.\n",
            "   “You saw it?”\n",
            "   “I thought I saw a small trapdoor open and shut. May I have your cane?”\n",
            "   He gave me the cane. I tapped the ground. It happened again.\n",
            "   “A spider!” I cried. “Gone! God, how quick!”\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” Sir Robert muttered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You know the old saying: in again, out again, Finnegan. Here.”\n",
            "   With his penknife, Sir Robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of earth, breaking off bits to show me the tunnel. The spider, in panic, leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground.\n",
            "   Sir Robert handed me the tunnel. “Like gray velvet. Feel. A model builder, that small chap. A tiny shelter, camouflaged, and him alert. He could hear a fly walk. Then pounce out, seize, pop back, slam the lid!”\n",
            "   “I didnt know you loved Nature.”\n",
            "   “Loathe it. But this wee chap, theres much we share. Doors. Hinges. Wouldnt consider other arachnids. But my love of portals drew me to study this incredible carpenter.” Sir Robert worked the trap on its cobweb hinges. “What craftsmanship! And it all ties to the tragedies!”\n",
            "   “The murdered children?”\n",
            "   Sir Robert nodded. “Notice any special thing about this forest?”\n",
            "   “Its too quiet.”\n",
            "   “Quiet!” Sir Robert smiled weakly. “Vast quantities of silence. No familiar birds, beetles, crickets, toads. Not a rustle or stir. The police didnt notice. Why should they? But it was this absence of sound and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders.”\n",
            "   He toyed with the amazing structure in his hands.\n",
            "   “What would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough, in a hideout big enough, so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound, be seized, and vanish with a soft thud below. How say you?” Sir Robert stared at the trees. “Poppycock and bilge? Yet, why not? Evolution, selection, growth, mutations, and-pfft!”\n",
            "   Again he tapped with his cane. A trapdoor flew open, shut.\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” he said.\n",
            "   The sky darkened.\n",
            "   “Rain!” Casting a cold gray eye at the clouds, he stretched his frail hand to touch the showers. “Damn! Arachnids hate rain. And so will our huge dark Finnegan.”\n",
            "   “Finnegan!” I cried irritably.\n",
            "   “I believe in him, yes.”\n",
            "   “A spider larger than a child?!”\n",
            "   “Twice as large.”\n",
            "   The cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us. “Lord, I hate to leave. Quick, before we go. Here.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raked away the old leaves with his cane, revealing two globular gray-brown objects.\n",
            "   “What are they?” I bent. “Old cannonballs?”\n",
            "   “No.” He cracked the grayish globes. “Soil, through and through.”\n",
            "   I touched the crumbled bits.\n",
            "   “Our Finnegan excavates,” said Sir Robert. “To make his tunnel. With his large rakelike chelicerae he dislodges soil, works it into a ball, carries it in his jaws, and drops it beyond his hole.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm. “Normal balls evicted from a tiny trapdoor tunnel. Toy-size.” He knocked his cane on the huge globes at our feet. “Explain those!”\n",
            "   I laughed. “The children mustve made them with mud!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense!” cried Sir Robert irritably, glaring about at trees and earth. “By God, somewhere, our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid. We might be standing on it. Christ, dont stare! His door has beveled rims. Some architect, this Finnegan. A genius at camouflage.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raved on and on, describing the dark earth, the arachnid, its fiddling legs, its hungry mouth, as the wind roared and the trees shook.\n",
            "   Suddenly, Sir Robert flung up his cane.\n",
            "   “No!” he cried.\n",
            "   I had no time to turn. My flesh froze, my heart stopped.\n",
            "   Something snatched my spine.\n",
            "   I thought I heard a huge bottle uncorked, a lid sprung. Then this monstrous thing crawled down my back.\n",
            "   “Here!” cried Sir Robert. “Now!”\n",
            "   He struck with his cane. I fell, dead weight. He thrust the thing from my spine. He lifted it.\n",
            "   The wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it onto my back.\n",
            "   Weakly, I tried to rise, shivering. “Silly,” I said a dozen times. “Silly. Damn awful silly!”\n",
            "   “Silly, no. Brandy, yes!” said Sir Robert. “Brandy?”\n",
            "   The sky was very black now. The rain swarmed over us.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Door after door after door, and at last into Sir Roberts country house study. A warm, rich room, where a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth. We devoured our sandwiches, waiting for the rain to cease. Sir Robert estimated that it would stop by eight oclock, when, by moonlight, we might return, ever so reluctantly, to Chatham Forest. I remembered the fallen branch, its spidering touch, and drank both wine and brandy.\n",
            "   “The silence in the forest,” said Sir Robert, finishing his meal. “What murderer could achieve such a silence?”\n",
            "   “An insanely clever man with a series of baited, poisoned traps, with liberal quantities of insecticide, might kill off every bird, every rabbit, every insect,” I said.\n",
            "   “Why should he do that?”\n",
            "   “To convince us that there is a large spider nearby. To perfect his act.”\n",
            "   “We are the only ones who have noticed this silence; the police did not. Why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing?”\n",
            "   “Why is a murderer? you might well ask.”\n",
            "   “I am not convinced.” Sir Robert topped his food with wine. “This creature, with a voracious mouth, has cleansed the forest. With nothing left, he seized the children. The silence, the murders, the prevalence of trapdoor spiders, the large earth balls, it all fits.”\n",
            "   Sir Roberts fingers crawled about the desktop, quite like a washed, manicured spider in itself. He made a cup of his frail hands, held them up.\n",
            "   “At the bottom of a spiders burrow is a dustbin into which drop insect remnants on which the spider has dined. Imagine the dustbin of our Grand Finnegan!”\n",
            "   I imagined. I visioned a Great Legged thing fastened to its dark lid under the forest and a child running, singing in the half-light. A brisk insucked whisk of air, the song cut short, then nothing but an empty glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid, and beneath the dark earth the spider, fiddling, cabling, spinning the stunned child in its silently orchestrating legs.\n",
            "   What would the dustbin of such an incredible spider resemble? What the remnants of many banquets? I shuddered.\n",
            "   “Rains letting up.” Sir Robert nodded his approval. “Back to the forest. Ive mapped the damned place for weeks. All the bodies were found in one half-open glade. Thats where the assassin, if it was a man, arrives! Or where the unnatural silk-spinning, earth-tunneling architect of special doors abides his tomb.”\n",
            "   “Must I hear all this?” I protested.\n",
            "   “Listen more.” Sir Robert downed the last of his burgundy. “The poor childrens prolapsed corpses were found at thirteen-day intervals. Which means that every two weeks our loathsome eight-legged hide-and-seeker must feed. Tonight is the fourteenth night after the last child was found, nothing but skin. Tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh. So! Within the hour, I shall introduce you to Finnegan the great and horrible!”\n",
            "   “All of which,” I said, “makes me want to drink.”\n",
            "   “Here I go.” Sir Robert stepped through one of his Louis the Fourteenth portals. “To find the last and final and most awful door in all my life. You will follow.”\n",
            "   Damn, yes! I followed.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The sun had set, the rain was gone, and the clouds cleared off to show a cold and troubled moon. We moved in our own silence and the silence of the exhausted paths and glades while Sir Robert handed me a small silver pistol.\n",
            "   “Not that that would help. Killing an outsize arachnid is sticky. Hard to know where to fire the first shot. If you miss, therell be no time for a second. Damned things, large or small, move in the instant!”\n",
            "   “Thanks.” I took the weapon. “I need a drink.”\n",
            "   “Done.” Sir Robert handed me a silver brandy flask. “Drink as needed.”\n",
            "   I drank. “What about you?”\n",
            "   “I have my own special flask.” Sir Robert lifted it. “For the right time.”\n",
            "   “Why wait?”\n",
            "   “I must surprise the beast and mustnt be drunk at the encounter. Four seconds before the thing grabs me, I will imbibe of this dear Napoleon stuff, spiced with a rude surprise.\n",
            "   “Surprise?”\n",
            "   “Ah, wait. Youll see. So will this dark thief of life. Now, dear sir, here we part company. I this way, you yonder. Do you mind?”\n",
            "   “Mind when Im scared gutless? Whats that?”\n",
            "   “Here. If I should vanish.” He handed me a sealed letter. “Read it aloud to the constabulary. It will help them locate me and Finnegan, lost and found.”\n",
            "   “Please, no details. I feel like a damned fool following you while Finnegan, if he exists, is underfoot snug and warm, saying, “Ah, those idiots above running about, freezing. I think Ill let them freeze. ““\n",
            "   “One hopes not. Get away now. If we walk together, he wont jump up. Alone, hell peer out the merest crack, glom the scene with a huge bright eye, flip down again, ssst, and one of us gone to darkness.”\n",
            "   “Not me, please. Not me.”\n",
            "   We walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in the half moonlight.\n",
            "   “Are you there?” called Sir Robert from half the world away in leafy dark.\n",
            "   “I wish I werent,” I yelled back.\n",
            "   “Onward!” cried Sir Robert. “Dont lose sight of me. Move closer. Were near on the site. I can intuit, I almost feel—”\n",
            "   As a final cloud shifted, moonlight glowed brilliantly to show Sir Robert waving his arms about like antennae, eyes half shut, gasping with expectation.\n",
            "   “Closer, closer,” I heard him exhale. “Near on. Be still. Perhaps...\n",
            "   He froze in place. There” was something in his aspect that made me want to leap, race, and yank him off the turf he had chosen.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert, oh, God!” I cried. “Run!”\n",
            "   He froze. One hand and arm orchestrated the air, feeling, probing, while his other hand delved, brought forth his silver-coated flask of brandy. He held it high in the moonlight, a toast to doom. Then, afflicted with need, he took one, two, three, my God, four incredible swigs!\n",
            "   Arms out, balancing the wind, tilting his head back, laughing like a boy, he swigged the last of his mysterious drink.\n",
            "   “All right, Finnegan, below and beneath!” he cried. “Come get me!”\n",
            "   He stomped his foot.\n",
            "   Cried out victorious.\n",
            "   And vanished.\n",
            "   It was all over in a second.\n",
            "   A flicker, a blur, a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a whisper, a suction, and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut.\n",
            "   The glade was empty.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert. Quick!”\n",
            "   But there was no one to quicken.\n",
            "   Not thinking that I might be snatched and vanished, I lurched to the spot where Sir Robert had drunk his wild toast.\n",
            "   I stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles, dry grass, and earth.\n",
            "   I must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog, then fell to my knees, fearless, to dig for lids, for tunneled tombs where a voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves, binding and mummifying a thing that had been my friend. This is his final door, I thought insanely, crying the name of my friend.\n",
            "   I found only his pipe, cane, and empty brandy flask, flung down when he had escaped night, life, everything.\n",
            "   Swaying up, I fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering earth, a dumb thing gone stupid as I finished and staggered over his instant graveyard, his locked-in tomb, listening for muffled screams, shrieks, cries, but heard none. I ran in circles, with no ammunition save my weeping shouts. I would have stayed all night, but a downpour of leaves, a great spidering flourish of broken branches, fell to panic and suffer my heart. I fled, still calling his name to a silence lidded by clouds that hid the moon.\n",
            "   At his estate, I beat on the door, wailing, yanking, until I recalled: it opened inward, it was unlocked.\n",
            "   Alone in the library, with only liquor to help me live, I read the letter that Sir Robert had left behind:\n",
            "   \n",
            "   My dear Douglas:\n",
            "   I am old and have seen much but am not mad. Finnegan exists. My chemist had provided me with a sure poison that I will mix in my brandy for our walk. I will drink all. Finnegan, not knowing me as a poisoned morsel will give me a swift invite. Now you see me, now you dont. I will then be the weapon of his death, minutes after my own. I do not think there is another outsize nightmare like him on earth. Once gone, thats the end.\n",
            "   Being old, I am immensely curious. I fear not death, for my physicians tell me that f no accidents kill me, cancer will.\n",
            "   I thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin. But then Id never know where he was or if he really existed. Finnegan would die unseen in his monstrous closet, and I never the wiser. This way, for one victorious moment, I will know. Fear for me. Envy me. Pray for me. Sorry to abandon you without farewells. Dear friend, carry on.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   I folded the letter and wept.\n",
            "   No more was ever heard of him.\n",
            "   Some say Sir Robert killed himself, an actor in his own melodrama, and that one day we shall unearth his brooding, lost, and Gothic body and that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with doors and hinges, and more doors, led him, crazed, to study this one species of spider, and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in history, an insane burrow into which he popped to die, before my eyes, thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible Finnegan.\n",
            "   But I have found no burrow. I do not believe a man could construct such a pit, even given Sir Roberts overwhelming passion for doors.\n",
            "   I can only ask, would a man murder, draw his victims” blood, build an earthen vault? For what motive? Create the finest secret exit in all time? Madness. And what of those large grayish balls of earth supposedly tossed forth from the spiders lair?\n",
            "   Somewhere, Finnegan and Sir Robert lie clasped in a velvet-lined unmarked crypt, deep under. Whether one is the paranoiac alter ego of the other, I cannot say. But the murders have ceased, the rabbits once more rush in Chatham Forest, and its bushes teem with butterflies and birds. It is another spring, and the children run again through a loud glade, no longer silent.\n",
            "   Finnegan and Sir Robert, requiescat in peace.\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "THAT WOMAN ON THE LAWN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Very late at night he heard the weeping on the lawn in front of his house. It was the sound of a woman crying. By its sound he knew it was not a girl or a mature woman, but the crying of someone eighteen or nineteen years old. It went on, then faded and stopped, and again started up, now moving this way or that on the late-summer wind.\n",
            "   He lay in bed listening to it until it made his eyes fill with tears. He turned over, shut his eyes, let the tears fall, but could not stop the sound. Why should a young woman be weeping long after midnight out there?\n",
            "   He sat up and the weeping stopped.\n",
            "   At the window, he looked down. The lawn was empty but covered with dew. There was a trail of footsteps across the lawn to the middle where someone had stood turning, and another trail going off toward the garden around the house.\n",
            "   The moon stood full in the sky and filled the lawn with its light, but there was no more sadness and only the footprints there.\n",
            "   He stepped back from the window, suddenly chilled, and went down to heat and drink a cup of chocolate.\n",
            "   He did not think of the weeping again until dusk the  day, and even then thought that it must be some woman from a house nearby, unhappy with life, perhaps locked out and in need of a place to let her sadness go.\n",
            "   Yet...?\n",
            "   As the twilight deepened, coming home he found himself hurrying from the bus, at a steady pace which astonished him. Why, why all this?\n",
            "   Idiot, he thought. A woman unseen weeps under your window, and here at sunset the  day, you almost run.\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, but her voice!\n",
            "   Was it beautiful, then?\n",
            "   No. Only familiar.\n",
            "   Where had he heard such a voice before, wordless in crying?\n",
            "   Who could he ask, living in an empty house from which his parents had vanished long ago?\n",
            "   He turned in at his front lawn and stood still, his eyes shadowed.\n",
            "   What had he expected? That whoever she was would be waiting here? Was he that lonely that a single voice long after midnight roused all his senses?\n",
            "   No. Simply put: he must know who the crying woman was.\n",
            "   And he was certain she would return tonight as he slept.\n",
            "   He went to bed at eleven, and awoke at three, panicked that he had missed a miracle. Lightning had destroyed a nearby town or an earthquake had shaken half the world to dust, and he had slept through it!\n",
            "   Fool! he thought, and slung back the covers and moved to the window, to see that indeed he had overslept.\n",
            "   For there on the lawn were the delicate footprints.\n",
            "   And he hadnt even heard the weeping!\n",
            "   He would have gone out to kneel in the grass, but at that moment a police car motored slowly by, looking at nothing and the night.\n",
            "   How could he run to prowl, to probe, to touch the grass if that car came by again? What doing? Picking clover blossoms? Weeding dandelions? What, what?\n",
            "   His bones cracked with indecision. He would go down, he would not.\n",
            "   Already the memory of that terrible weeping faded the more he tried to make it clear. If he missed her one more night, the memory itself might be gone.\n",
            "   Behind him, in his room, the alarm clock rang. Damn! he thought. What time did I set it for? He shut off the alarm and sat on his bed, rocking gently, waiting, eyes shut, listening.\n",
            "   The wind shifted. The tree just outside the window whispered and stirred.\n",
            "   He opened his eyes and leaned forward. From far off, coming near, and now down below, the quiet sound of a woman weeping.\n",
            "   She had come back to his lawn and was not forever lost. Be very quiet, he thought.\n",
            "   And the sounds she made came up on the wind through the blowing curtains into his room.\n",
            "   Careful now. Careful but quick.\n",
            "   He moved to the window and looked down.\n",
            "   In the middle of the lawn she stood and wept, her hair long and dark on her shoulders, her face bright with tears.\n",
            "   And there was something in the way her hands trembled at her sides, the way her hair moved quietly in the wind, that shook him so that he almost fell.\n",
            "   He knew her and yet did not. He had seen her before, but had never seen.\n",
            "   Turn your head, he thought.\n",
            "   Almost as if hearing this, the young woman sank to her knees to half kneel on the grass, letting the wind comb her hair, head down and weeping so steadily and bitterly that he wanted to cry out: Oh, no! It kills my heart!\n",
            "   And as if she had heard, quite suddenly her head lifted, her weeping grew less as she looked up at the moon, so that he saw her face.\n",
            "   And it was indeed a face seen somewhere once, but where?\n",
            "   A tear fell. She blinked.\n",
            "   It was like the blinking of a camera and a picture taken.\n",
            "   “God save me!” he whispered. “No!”\n",
            "   He whirled and stumbled toward the closet to seize down an avalanche of boxes and albums. In the dark he scrabbled, then pulled on the closet light, tossed aside six albums until finally, dragging another forth and riffling pages, he gave a cry, stopped, and held a photo close, then turned and moved blindly to the window.\n",
            "   There he stared down at the lawn and then at the photograph, very old, very yellowed with age.\n",
            "   Yes, yes, the same! The image struck his eyes and then his heart. His whole body shook, made an immense pulsation, as he leaned at the album, leaned on the window frame, and almost shouted:\n",
            "   You! How dare you come back! How dare you be young! How dare you be what? A girl untouched, wandering late on my lawn!? You were never that young! Never! Damn, oh, damn your warm blood, damn your wild soul!\n",
            "   But this he did not shout or say.\n",
            "   For something in his eyes, like a beacon, must have flashed.\n",
            "   The crying of the young woman on the lawn stopped.\n",
            "   She looked up.\n",
            "   At which instant the album fell from his fingers, through the burst-wide screen, and down like a dark bird fluttering to strike the earth.\n",
            "   The young man gave a muted cry, whirled, and ran. “No, no!” he cried aloud. “I didnt mean-come back!” He was down the stairs and out on the porch in a matter of seconds. The door slammed behind him like a gunshot. The explosion nailed him to the rail, half down to the lawn, where there was nothing to be seen but footprints. Either way, up the street lay empty sidewalks and shadows under trees. A radio played off in an upstairs window in a house behind trees. A car passed, murmuring, at a far intersection.\n",
            "   “Wait,” he whispered. “Come back. I shouldnt have said—”\n",
            "   He stopped. He had said nothing, but only thought it. But his outrage, his jealousy?\n",
            "   She had felt that. She had somehow heard. And now...?\n",
            "   Shell never come back, he thought. Oh God!\n",
            "   He sat on the porch steps for a while, quietly biting his knuckle.\n",
            "   At three in the morning, in bed, he thought he heard a sigh and soft footsteps in grass, and waited. The photo album lay closed on the floor. Even though it lay shut, he could see and know her face. And it was utterly impossible, utterly insane.\n",
            "   His last thought before sleep was: ghost.\n",
            "   The strangest ghost that ever walked.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone dead.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone who died very old.\n",
            "   But somehow come back not as her old self.\n",
            "   But a ghost that was somehow young.\n",
            "   Werent ghosts always, when they returned, the same age as when they died?\n",
            "   No.\n",
            "   Not this one anyway.\n",
            "   “Why...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   And dream took over the whisper.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One night passed and then another and another, and there was nothing on the lawn but the light of a moon that changed its face from outright stare to half grimace.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   The first night a more than ordinarily casual cat crossed the yard at two a. m.\n",
            "   The second night a dog trotted by, wearing his tongue half out of his mouth like a loosely tied red cravat, smiling at trees.\n",
            "   The third night a spider spent from twelve-twenty-five until four a. m. building a baroque clockface on the air between lawn and trees, which a bird broke in passing at dawn.\n",
            "   He slept most of Sunday and awoke with a fever that was not an illness at dusk.\n",
            "   Late in the twilight of the fifth day, the color of the sky somehow promised her return, as did the way the wind leaned against the trees and the look of the moon when it finally rose to set the scene.\n",
            "   “All right,” he said, half aloud. “Now.” But at midnight, nothing.\n",
            "   “Come on,” he whispered.\n",
            "   One oclock, nothing.\n",
            "   You must, he thought.\n",
            "   No, you will.\n",
            "   He slept for ten minutes and woke suddenly at two-ten, knowing that when he went to the window—\n",
            "   She would be there.\n",
            "   She was.\n",
            "   At first, he didnt see her, and groaned, and then, in the shadow of the great oak far out on the edge of the lawn, he saw something move, and one foot came out, and she took a step and stood very still.\n",
            "   He held his breath, quieted his heart, told himself to turn, walk, and take each step down with precision, numbering them, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, moving in darkness with no rush, six, five, four, and at last one. He opened the front screen door with only a whisper, and was on the porch without frightening what might be out beyond waiting for him.\n",
            "   Quietly, he moved down the porch steps to the edge of the lawn, like one who stands on the rim of a pond. Out in the center of that pond, the young woman stood, trapped like someone on thin ice that might at any moment break and drop her through.\n",
            "   She did not see him. And then... \n",
            "   She did a thing that was a signal. Tonight her hair was fixed in a knot at the back of her head. She lifted her white arms in a gesture and with one touch of her fingers, a touch of snow, loosened her hair.\n",
            "   It fell in a dark banner, to blow and repattern itself across her shoulders, which trembled with their shadows.\n",
            "   The wind stirred her hair in the night and moved it about her face and on her uplifted hands.\n",
            "   The shadows laid down by the moon under every tree leaned as if called by the motion.\n",
            "   The entire world shifted in its sleep.\n",
            "   The wind blew as the young woman waited.\n",
            "   But no footsteps sounded along the white sidewalks. No front doors opened far down the street. No windows were raised. No motion caused front porches to creak and shift.\n",
            "   He took another step out onto the small meadow of night.\n",
            "   “Who are you-?” she gasped, and stepped back. “No, no,” he said softly. “Its all right.” Another trembling had taken over her body. Where before it had been some hope, some anticipation, now it was fear. One hand stopped her hair from blowing; the other half shielded her face.\n",
            "   “Ill stand right here,” he said. “Believe me. “” She waited a long while, staring at him until her shoulders\n",
            "   relaxed and the lines around her mouth vanished. Her whole body sensed the truth of his words.\n",
            "   “I dont understand,” she said.\n",
            "   “I dont either.” “What are you doing here?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” “What am I doing here?”\n",
            "   “You came to meet someone,” he said.\n",
            "   “Did I?”\n",
            "   The town clock struck three in the morning far away. She listened to it, her face shadowed by the sound.\n",
            "   “But its so late. People dont walk around late on front lawns!”\n",
            "   “They do if they must,” he said.\n",
            "   “But why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe we can find out, if we talk.”\n",
            "   “About what, what?!”\n",
            "   “About why youre here. If we talk long enough, we may know. I know why Im here, of course. I heard you crying.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Im so ashamed.”\n",
            "   “Dont be. Why are people ashamed of tears? I cry often. Then I start laughing. But the crying must come first. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “What a strange man you are.”\n",
            "   Her hand fell away from her hair. Her other hand moved away so her face was illuminated by a small and growing curiosity.\n",
            "   “I thought I was the only one who knew about crying,” she said.\n",
            "   “Everyone thinks that. Its one of those little secrets we keep from each other. Show me a serious man and Ill show you a man who has never wept. Show me a madman and Ill show you a man who dried his tears a long time ago. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “I think Im done,” she said.\n",
            "   “Any time, start over.”\n",
            "   She burst out a tiny laugh. “Oh, you are strange. Who are you?”\n",
            "   “Well come to that.”\n",
            "   She peered across the lawn at his hands, his face, his mouth, and then at his eyes.\n",
            "   “Oh, I know you. But from where?!”\n",
            "   “That would spoil it. You wouldnt believe, anyway.”\n",
            "   “I would!”\n",
            "   Now it was his turn to laugh quietly. “Youre very young.”\n",
            "   “No, nineteen! Ancient!”\n",
            "   “Girls, by the time they go from twelve to nineteen, are full of years, yes. I dont know; but it must be so. Now, please, why are you out here in the middle of the night?”\n",
            "   “I—” She shut her eyes to think in on it. “Im waiting.”\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   “And Im sad.”\n",
            "   “Its the waiting that makes you sad, yes?”\n",
            "   “I think, no, yes, no.”\n",
            "   “And you dont quite know what youre waiting for?”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wish I could be sure. All of mes waiting. I dont know, all of me. I dont understand. Im impossible!”\n",
            "   “No, youre everyone that ever grew up too fast and wanted too much. I think girls, women, like you have slipped out at night since time began. If it wasnt here in Green Town, it was in Cairo or Alexandria or Rome or Paris in summer, anywhere there was a private place and late hours and no one to see, so they just rose up and out, as if someone had called their name—”\n",
            "   “I was called, yes! Thats it! Someone did call my name! Its true. How did you know? Was it you!”\n",
            "   “No. But someone we both know. Youll know his name when you go back to bed tonight, wherever that is.”\n",
            "   “Why, in that house, behind you,” she said. “Thats my house. I was born in it.”\n",
            "   “Well”-he laughed-“so was I.”\n",
            "   “You? How can that be? Are you sure?”\n",
            "   “Yes. Anyway, you heard someone calling. You had to come out—”\n",
            "   “I did. Many nights now. But, always, no ones here. They must be there, or why would I hear them?”\n",
            "   “One day therell be someone to fit the voice.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont joke with me!”\n",
            "   “Im not. Believe. There will be. Thats what all those other women heard in other years and places, middle of summer, dead of winter, go out and risk cold, stand warm in snow banks, and listen and look for strange footprints on the midnight snow, and only an old dog trotting by, all smiles. Damn, damn.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes, damn, damn.” And her smile showed for a moment, even as the moon came out of the clouds and went away. “Isnt it silly?”\n",
            "   “No. Men do the same. They take long walks when theyre sixteen, seventeen. They dont stand on lawns, waiting, no. But, my God, how they walk! Miles and miles from midnight until dawn and come home exhausted and explode and die in bed.”\n",
            "   “What a shame that those who stand and wait and those who walk all night cant—”\n",
            "   “Meet?”\n",
            "   “Yes; dont you think its a shame?”\n",
            "   “They do, finally.”\n",
            "   “Oh, no, I shall never meet anyone. Im old and ugly and terrible and I dont know how many nights Ive heard that voice making me come here and theres nothing and I just want to die.”\n",
            "   “Oh, lovely young girl,” he said gently. “Dont die. The cavalry is on its way. You will be saved.”\n",
            "   There was such certainty in his voice that it made her glance up again, for she had been looking at her hands and her own soul in her hands.\n",
            "   “You know, dont you?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “You truly know? You tell the truth?”\n",

            "   “Hide-and-seek, you mean? But its gone on too long!”\n",
            "   “Its almost over, Marie.”\n",
            "   “You know my name!”\n",
            "   He stopped, confused. He had not meant to speak it.\n",
            "   “How did you know, who are you?” she demanded.\n",
            "   “When you get back to sleep tonight, youll know. If we say too much, youll disappear, or Ill disappear. Im not quite sure which of us is real or which is a ghost.”\n",
            "   “Not me! Oh, surely not me. I can feel myself. Im here. Why, look!” And she showed him the remainder of her tears brushed from her eyelids and held on her palms.\n",
            "   “Oh, thats real, all right. Well, then, dear young woman, I must be the visitor. I come to tell you it will all go right. Do you believe in special ghosts?”\n",
            "   “Are you special?”\n",
            "   “One of us is. Or maybe both. The ghost of young love or the ghost of the unborn.”\n",

            "   “Paradoxes arent easy to explain.”\n",
            "   “Then, depending on how you look at it, youre impossible, and so am I.”\n",
            "   “If it makes it easier, just think Im not really here. Do you believe in ghosts?”\n",
            "   “I think I do.”\n",
            "   “It comes to me to imagine, then, that there are special ghosts in the world. Not ghosts of dead people. But ghosts of want and need, or I guess you might say desire.”\n",
            "   “I dont understand.”\n",
            "   “Well, have you ever lain in bed late afternoons, late nights and dreamed something so much, awake, you felt your soul jump out of your body as if something had yanked a long, pure white sheet straight out the window? You want something so much, your soul leaps out and follows, my God, fast?”\n",
            "   “Why... yes. Yes!”\n",
            "   “Boys do that, men do that. When I was twelve I read Burroughs” Mars novels. John Carter used to stand under the stars, hold up his arms to Mars, and ask to be taken.\n",
            "   And Mars grabbed his soul, yanked him like an aching tooth across space, and landed him in dead Martian seas. Thats boys, thats men.”\n",
            "   “And girls, women?”\n",
            "   “They dream, yes. And their ghosts come out of their bodies. Living ghosts. Living wants. Living needs.”\n",
            "   “And go to stand on lawns in the middle of winter nights?”\n",
            "   “Thats about it.”\n",

Very soon, now, a voice will call and when you come out, both of you, your ghost of want and your body with it, there will be a man to go with the voice that calls.”\n",
            "   “Oh, please dont tell me that if it isnt true!” Her voice trembled. Tears flashed again in her eyes. She half raised her arms again in defense.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt dream to hurt you. I only came to tell.” The town clock struck again in the deep morning. “Its late,” she said.\n",
            "   “Very late. Get along, now.” “Is that all youre going to say?” “You dont need to know any more.” The last echoes of the great clock faded.\n",
            "   “How strange,” she murmured. “The ghost of a question, the ghost of an answer.”\n",
            "   “What better ghosts can there be?”\n",
            "   “None that I ever heard of. Were twins.”\n",

            "   “Why,” he said, and he suddenly knew. He knew where to send her and was suddenly angry with himself for knowing, angry with her for asking. A burst of jealousy welled in him. He wanted to race down the street to a certain house where a certain young man lived in another year and break the window, burn the roof. And yet, oh, yet, if he did that!?\n",
            "   “Yes?” she said, for he had kept her waiting.\n",
            "   Now, he thought, you must tell her. Theres no escape.\n",
            "   For if you dont tell her, angry fool, you yourself will never be born.\n",

            "   \t“Oh, yes!”\n",

            "   “Eleven Green Park.”\n",
            "   “Oh, thank you, thank you!” She ran a few steps, then stopped, bewildered. Her hands were helpless at her throat. Her mouth trembled. “Silly. I hate to leave.”\n",

            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Tears absolutely burst from her eyes. He wept with her.\n",

            "   He opened his eyes wide. He realized what she was trying to do. It was so ridiculous he almost cried out with laughter!\n",
            "   His rickety, jaundiced, eighty-five-year-old wife was trying to strangle him!\n",
            "   She panted forth a rum-and-bitters smell as she perched there, toppling like a drunken moth, tinkering away as if he were a toy. She sighed irritably and her skinny fingers began to swear as she gasped, “Why dont you, oh, why don “t you?”\n",
            "   Why dont I what? he wondered idly, lying there. He swallowed and this faint action of his Adams apple dislodged her feeble clutch. Why dont I die; is that it? he cried silently. He lay another few moments, wondering if shed gain strength enough to do him in. She didnt.\n",
            "   Should he snap on the light to confront her? Wouldnt she look a silly ass, a skinny chicken aloft sidesaddle on her hated husbands amazed body, and him laughing?\n",
            "   Joshua Enderby groaned and yawned. “Missy?”\n",
            "   Her hands froze on his collarbone.\n",
            "   “Will you—” He turned, pretending half sleep. “Will you-please” “-he yawned—” “move to your side—of the bed? Eh? Good girl.”\n",
            "   Missy moved off in the dark. He heard ice tinkle. She was having another shot of rum.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   At noon the  day, enjoying the weather and waiting for luncheon guests to arrive, old Joshua and Missy traded drinks in the garden pavilion. He handed her Dubonnet; she gave him sherry.\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence as both eyed the stuff and hesitated to sip. He handled his glass in such a way that his large white diamond ring sparked and glittered on his palsied hand. Its light made him flinch and at last he gathered his phlegm.\n",
            "   “Missy,” he said. “You havent long to live, you know.” Missy was hidden behind jonquils in a crystal bowl and now peered out at her mummified husband. Both perceived that the others hands shook. She wore a cobalt dress, heavily iced with luncheon jewels, little glittery planets under each ear, a scarlet design for a mouth. The ancient whore of Babylon, he thought dryly.\n",
            "   “How odd, my dear, how very odd,” Missy said with a polite scrape of her voice. “Why, only last night—”\n",
            "   “You were thinking of me?”\n",
            "   “We must talk.”\n",
            "   “Yes, we must.” He leaned like a wax mannequin in his chair. “No rush. But if I do you in, or if you do me in (it matters not which), lets protect each other, yes? Oh, dont look at me in amaze, my dear. I was perfectly aware of your little gallup last night on my ribs, fumbling with my esophagus, feeling the tumblers click, or whatever.”\n",
            "   “Dear me.” Blood rose in Missys powdery cheeks. “Were you awake all during? Im mortified. I think I shall have to go lie down.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense.” Joshua stopped her. “If I die, you should be shielded so no onell accuse you. Same with me, if you die. Why go to all the trouble of trying to-eliminate-each other if it just means a gallows-drop or a french fry.”\n",
            "   “Logical enough,” she agreed.\n",
            "   “I suggest a-a series of mash notes to each other. Umm, lavish displays of sentiment before friends, gifts, et cetera. Ill run up bills for flowers, diamond bracelets. You purchase fine leather wallets and gold-ferruled canes for me.”\n",
            "   “You have a head for things, I must say,” she admitted.\n",
            "   “It will help allay suspicion if we appear madly, anciently in love.”\n",
            "   “You know,” she said tiredly, “it doesnt matter, Joshua, which of us dies first, except that Im very old and would like to do one thing right in my life. Ive always been such a dilettante. Ive never liked you. Loved you, yes, but thats ten million years back. You never were a friend. If it werent for the children—”\n",
            "   “Motives are bilge,” he said. “We are two querulous old pots with nothing to do but kick off, and make a circus of that. But how much better the dying game if we write a few rules, act it neatly, with no one the wiser. How long has this assassination plot of yours been active?”\n",
            "   She beamed. “Remember the opera last week? You slipped from the curb? That car almost nailed you?”\n",
            "   “Good Lord.” He laughed. “I thought someone shoved both of us!” He leaned forward, chuckling. “Okay. When you fell in the bath last month? I greased the tub!”\n",
            "   Unthinkingly, she gasped, drank part of her Dubonnet, then froze.\n",
            "   Reading her mind, he stared at his own drink.\n",
            "   “This isnt poisoned, by any chance?” He sniffed his glass. “Dont be silly,” she replied, touching her Dubonnet with a lizards doubtful tongue. “Theyd find the residue in whats left of your stomach. Just be sure you double-check your shower tonight. I have kited the temperature, which might bring on a seizure.”\n",
            "   “You didnt!” he scoffed.\n",
            "   “Ive thought about it,” she confessed.\n",
            "   The front-door chimes rang, but not with their usual joy, sounding more funereal. Nonsense! Joshua thought. Bosh! thought Missy, then brightened:\n",
            "   “We have forgotten our luncheon guest! Thats the Gowrys! Hes a bore, but be nice! Fix your collar.”\n",
            "   “Its damned tight. Too much starch. One more plot to strangle me?”\n",

            "   And they marched, arm in arm, with idiot laughter, off to meet the half-forgotten Gowrys.\n",
            "   Cocktails were served. The old relics sat side by side, hands laced like school chums, laughing with weak heartiness at Gowrys dire jokes. They leaned forward to show him their porcelain smiles, saying, “Oh, thats a good one!” loudly, and, softly, sotto voce; to each other: “Thought of anything new?” “Electric razor in your bath?” “Not bad, not bad!”\n",
            "   “And then Pat said to Mike!” cried Mr. Gowry.\n",
            "   From the corner of his mouth Joshua whispered to Missy, “You know, I dislike you with something approaching the colossal proportions of first love. You have taught me mayhem. How?”\n",
            "   “When the teacher is ready, the pupil will arrive,” whispered Missy.\n",
            "   Laughter rose in tumbling, whirling waves. The room was giddy, airy, light. “So Pat says to Mike, do it yourself!” boomed Gowry.\n",
            "   “Oh, ho!” everyone exploded.\n",
            "   “Now, dear.” Missy waved at her ancient husband. “Tell one of your jokes. Oh, but first,” she remembered cleverly, “trot down-cellar, darling, and fetch the brandy.”\n",
            "   Gowry sprang forward with wild courtesy. “I know where it is!”\n",
            "   “Oh, Mr. Gowry, dont!”\n",
            "   Missy gestured frantically.\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry ran from the room.\n",
            "   “Oh, dear, dear me,” cried Missy.\n",
            "   A moment later, Gowry uttered a loud shriek from the basement, followed by a thunderous crash.\n",
            "   Missy hippety-hopped out, only to reappear moments later, her hand clutched to her throat. “Heavens to Betsy,” she wailed. “Come look. I do believe Mr. Gowry has pitched himself straight down the cellar stairs!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The  morning Joshua Enderby shuffled into the house lugging a large green velvet board some five feet by three, on which pistols were clasped in display.\n",
            "   “Here I am!” he shouted.\n",
            "   Missy appeared with a rum Collins in one bracelet-jangly hand, her cane thumping in the other. “Whats that?” she demanded.\n",
            "   “First, hows old Gowry?”\n",
            "   “Broken leg. Wished it had been his vocal cords.”\n",
            "   “Shame about that top cellar step gone loose, eh?” The old man hooked the green velvet board to the wall. “Good thing Gowry lurched for the brandy, not I.”\n",
            "   “Shame.” The wife drank thirstily. “Explain.”\n",
            "   “Im in the antique-gun-collecting business.” He waved at the weapons in their neat leather nests.\n",
            "   “I dont see—”\n",
            "   “With a collection of guns to clean-bang!” He beamed. “Man shoots wife while oiling matchlock garter pistol. Didnt know it was loaded, says weeping spouse.”\n",
            "   “Touche,” she said.\n",
            "   An hour later, while oiling a revolver, he almost blew his brains out.\n",
            "   His wife came thumping in and froze. “Hell. Youre still alive.”\n",
            "   “Loaded, by God!” He lifted the weapon in a trembling hand. “None were loaded! Unless—”\n",
            "   “Unless-?”\n",
            "   He seized three more weapons. “All loaded! You!”\n",
            "   “Me,” she said. “While you ate lunch. I suppose Ill have to give you tea now. Come along.”\n",
            "   He stared at the bullet hole in the wall. “Tea, hell,” he said. “Wheres the gin?!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was her turn for a shopping spree. “There are ants in the house.” She rattled her full shopping bag and set out ant-paste pots in all the rooms, sprinkled ant powders on windowsills, in his golf bag, and over his gun collection. From other sacks she drew rat poisons, mouse-killers, and bug-exterminators. “A bad summer for roaches.” She distributed these liberally among the foods.\n",
            "   “Thats a double-edged sword,” he observed. “Youll fall on it!”\n",
            "   “Bilge. The victim mustnt choose his demise.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but no violence. I wish a serene face for the coroner.”\n",
            "   “Vanity. Dear Josh, your face will twist like a corkscrew with one heaping teaspoon of Black Leaf Forty in your midnight cocoa!”\n",
            "   “I,” he shot back, “know a recipe that will break you out in a thousand lumps before expiring”\n",
            "   She quieted. “Why, Josh, I wouldnt dream of using Black Leaf Forty.”\n",
            "   He bowed. “I wouldnt dream of using the thousand-lump recipe.”\n",
            "   “Shake,” she said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Their assassins game continued. He bought huge rattraps to hide in the halls. “You run barefoot so: small wounds, large infections!”\n",
            "   She in turn stuck the sofas full of antimacassar pins. Wherever he laid a hand it drew blood. “Ow! Damn!” He sucked his fingers. “Are these Amazon Indian blowgun darts?”\n",
            "   “No. Just plain old rusty lockjaw needles.”\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said.\n",
            "   Though he was aging fast, Joshua Enderby dearly loved to drive. You could see him motoring with feeble wildness up and down the hills of Beverly, mouth gaped, eyes blinking palely.\n",
            "   One afternoon he phoned from Malibu. “Missy? My God, I almost dove from a cliff. My right front wheel flew off on a straightaway!”\n",
            "   “I planned it for a curve!”\n",
            "   “Sorry.”\n",

            "   “Poor Lila.”\n",
            "   “I send her everywhere ahead now. She bucketed down like a laundry bag. Lucky shes all fat.”\n",
            "   “Well kill that one between us if were not careful.”\n",
            "   “Do you think? Oh, I do like Lila so.”\n",
            "   “Lay Lila off for a spell. Hire someone new. If we catch them in our crossfire, wont be so sad. Hate to think of Lila smashed under a chandelier or—”\n",
            "   “Chandelier!” Missy shrieked. “You been fiddling with my grandmas Fountainbleu Palace crystal hangings? Listen here, mister. Youre not to touch that chandelier!”\n",
            "   “Promise,” he muttered.\n",
            "   “Good grief! Those lovely crystals! If they fell and missed me, Id hop on one leg to cane you to death, then wake you up and cane you again!”\n",

            "   “I wasnt hungry. I gave it to the new maid.”\n",
            "   “Idiot!”\n",

            "   There was a crash from the kitchen.\n",

            "   \n",
            "   They stashed the new maid in an attic trunk. No one telephoned to ask for her.\n",
            "   “Disappointing,” observed Missy on the seventh day. “I felt certain thered be a tall, cold man with a notebook and another with a camera and flashbulbs flashing. Poor girl was lonelier than we guessed.”\n",
            "   Cocktail parties streamed wildly through the house. It was Missys idea. “So we can pick each other off in a forest of obstacles; moving targets!”\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry, gamely returning to the house, limping after his tumble of some weeks before, joked, laughed, and didnt quite blow his ear off with one of the dueling pistols. Everyone roared but the party broke up early. Gowry vowed never to return.\n",
            "   Then there was a Miss Kummer, who, staying overnight, borrowed Joshuas electric razor and was almost but not quite electrocuted. She left the house rubbing her right underarm. Joshua promptly grew a beard.\n",
            "   Soon after, a Mr. Schlagel vanished. So did a Mr. Smith. The last seen of these unfortunates was at a Saturday night soiree at the Enderbys” mansion.\n",
            "   “Hide-and-seek?” Friends slapped Joshuas back jovially.\n",
            "   “How do you do it? Kill “em with toadstools, plant “em like mushrooms?”\n",
            "   “Grand joke, yes!” chortled Joshua. “No, no, ha, not toadstools, but one got locked in our stand-up fridge. Overnight Eskimo Pie. The other tripped on a croquet hoop. Defenestrated through a greenhouse window.”\n",
            "   “Eskimo Pie, defenestrated!” hooted the party people. “Dear Joshua, you are a card!”\n",
            "   “I speak only the truth,” Joshua protested.\n",

            "   Missy turned to stone; he had touched a nerve.\n",
            "   “Well, now, its time for a wee talk,” he said. “Cancel the parties. One more victim and sirens will announce the arrival of the law.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” Missy agreed. “Our target practice seems to wind up in ricochet. About that croquet hoop. You always take midnight greenhouse walks. Why was that damn fool Schlagel stumbling about out there at two a. m.? Dumb ox. Is he still under the compost?”\n",
            "   “Until I stash him with he-who-is-frozen.”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   That night by the fireplace, he poured a few glasses of their best port. While he was out of the room, answering the telephone, she dropped a little white powder in her own glass.\n",
            "   “Hate this,” she murmured. “Terribly unoriginal. But there wont be an inquest. He looked long dead before he died, theyll say as they shut the lid.” And she added a touch more lethal stuff to her port just as he wandered in to sit and pluck up his glass. He . eyed it and fixed his wife a grin. “Ah, no, no, you dont!”\n",
            "   “Dont what?” she said, all innocence.\n",
            "   The fire crackled warmly, gently on the hearth. The mantel clock ticked.\n",
            "   “You dont mind, do you, my dear, if we exchange drinks?”\n",
            "   “Surely you dont think I poisoned your drink while you were out?”\n",
            "   “Trite. Banal. But possible.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, fussbudget, trade.”\n",
            "   He looked surprised but traded glasses.\n",
            "   “Heres not looking at you!” both said, and laughed.\n",
            "   They drank with mysterious smiles.\n",
            "   And then they sat with immense satisfaction in their easy chairs, the firelight glimmering on their ghost-pale faces, letting the port warm their almost spidery veins. He stuck his legs out and held one hand to the fire. “Ah.” He sighed.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing quite like port!”\n",
            "   She leaned her small gray head back, dozing, gumming her red-sticky mouth, and glancing at him with half-secretive, lazy eyes. “Poor Lila,” she murmured.\n",
            "   “Yes,” he murmured. “Lila. Poor.”\n",
            "   The fire popped and she at last added, “Poor Mr. Schlagel.”\n",
            "   “Yes.” He drowsed. “Poor Schlagel. Dont forget Smith.”\n",

            "   “Sleepy.”\n",
            "   “Very sleepy?”\n",
            "   “Un-huh.” He studied her with bright eyes. “And, my dear, what about you?”\n",
            "   “Sleepy,” she said behind closed eyes. Then they popped wide. “Why all these questions?”\n",
            "   “Indeed,” he said, stirring alert. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Oh, well, because...” She examined her little black shoe moving in a low rhythm a long way off below her knee. “I think, or perhaps imagine, I have just destroyed your digestive and nervous systems.”\n",
            "   For the moment he was drowsily content and examined the warm fire and listened to the clock tick. “What you mean is that you have just poisoned me?” He dreamed the words. “You what!?” He jumped as all the air gusted from his body. The port glass shattered on the floor.\n",
            "   She leaned forward like a fortune-teller eagerly predicting futures.\n",
            "   “I cleverly poisoned my own drink and knew that youd ask to trade off, so you felt safe. And we did!” Her laugh tinkled.\n",
            "   He fell back in his chair, clutching at his face to stop the wild swiveling of his eyes. Then suddenly he remembered something and let out an incredible explosion of laughter.\n",
            "   “Why,” cried Missy, “why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “Because,” he gasped, tears streaming down his cheeks, his mouth grinning horribly, “I poisoned my drink! and hoped for an excuse to change with you!”\n",
            "   “Oh, dear,” she cried, no longer smiling. “How stupid of us. Why didnt I guess?”\n",
            "   “Because both of us are much too clever by far!” And he lay back, chortling.\n",
            "   “Oh, the mortification, the embarrassment, I feel stark naked and hate myself!”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he husked. “Think instead how much you still hate me.”\n",
            "   “With all my withered heart and soul. You?”\n",
            "   “No deathbed forgiveness here, old lily-white iron-maiden wife 0 mine. Cheerio,” he added faintly, far away.\n",
            "   “If you think Ill say “Cheerio” back, youre crazed,” she whispered, her head rolling to one side, her eyes clamped,\n",
            "   her mouth gone loose around the words. “But what the hell. Cheer—”\n",
            "   At which her breath ceased and the fire burned to ashes as the clock ticked and ticked in the quiet room.\n",
            "   Friends found them strewn in their library chairs the  day, both looking more than usually pleased with their situation.\n",
            "   “A suicide pact,” said all. “So great their love they could not bear to let the other vanish alone into eternity.”\n",

            "   A woman was sawed in half. How the husbands in the audience smiled.\n",
            "   A woman in a cabinet vanished. A bearded magician wept for her in despair. Then, at the tip-top of the balcony, she appeared, waving a white-powdered hand, infinitely beautiful, unattainable, far away.\n",
            "   How the wives grinned their cat grins!\n",
            "   “Look at them!” I said to my wife.\n",
            "   A woman floated in midair... a goddess born in all mens minds by their own true love. Let not her dainty feet touch earth. Keep her on that invisible pedestal. Watch it! God, dont tell me how its done, anyone! Ah, look at her float, and dream.\n",
            "   And what was that man who spun plates, globes, stars, torches, his elbows twirling hoops, his nose balancing a blue feather, sweating everything at once!

            "   Obviously, none of us had come to escape the world outside, but rather to have it tossed back at us in more easily digested forms, brighter, cleaner, quicker, neater; a spectacle both heartening and melancholy.\n",
            "   Who in life has not seen a woman disappear?\n",
            "   There, on the black, plush stage, women, mysteries of talc and rose petal, vanished. Cream alabaster statues, sculptures of summer lily and fresh rain melted to dreams, and the dreams became empty mirrors even as the magician reached hungrily to seize them.\n",
            "   From cabinets and nests of boxes, from flung sea-nets, shattering like porcelain as the conjurer fired his gun, the women vanished.\n",
            "   Symbolic, I thought. Why do magicians point pistols at lovely assistants, unless through some secret pact with the male subconscious?\n",

            "   I looked to see if she was joking. In the dark, her dim mouth seemed to be smiling, but the quality of that smile was lost to me.\n",

            "   But really, Miss Quick provoked me. For she looked as if she had gone backstage, shrugged on a rumpled tweed walking suit, one size too large, gravy-spotted and grass-stained, and then purposely rumpled her hair, painted her lipstick askew, and was on the point of exiting the stage door when someone cried, “Youre on!”\n",
            "   So here she was now, in her practical shoes, her nose shiny, her hands in motion but her face immobile, getting it over with .\n",

            "   “Here.”\n",
            "   With a smile like the very driest wine, she lazily unwedged a wallet from one of her pockets. She removed another wallet from within her coat. Followed by a third, a fourth, a fifth! Ten wallets in all!\n",
            "   She held them forth, like biscuits, to good beasts. The men blinked. No, those were not their wallets! They had been onstage for only an instant. She had mingled with them only in passing. It was all a joke. Surely she was offering them brand-new wallets, compliments of the show!\n",
            "   But now the men began feeling themselves, like sculptures finding unseen flaws in old, hastily flung together armatures. Their mouths gaped, their hands grew more frantic, slapping their chest-pockets, digging their pockets.\n",
            "   All the while Miss Quick ignored them to calmly sort their wallets like the morning mail.\n",
            "   It was at this precise moment I noticed the man on the far right end of the line, half on the stage. I lifted my opera glasses. I looked once. I looked twice.\n",
            "   “Well,” I said lightly. “There seems to be a man there who somewhat resembles me.”\n",
            "   “Oh?” said my wife.\n",
            "   I handed her the glasses, casually. “Far right.”\n",
            "   “Its not like you,” said my wife. “Its you!”\n",
            "   “Well, almost,” I said modestly.\n",
            "   The fellow was nice-looking. It was hardly cricket to look thus upon yourself and pronounce favorable verdicts. Simultaneously, I had grown quite cold. I took back the opera glasses and nodded, fascinated. “Crew cut. Horn-rimmed glasses. Pink complexion. Blue eyes—”\n",
            "   “Your absolute twin!” cried my wife.\n",
            "   And this was true. And it was strange, sitting there, watching myself onstage.\n",
            "   “No, no, no,” I kept whispering.\n",

            "   She shook their vests, pinched their lapels, jingled their trousers: money rang. She punched them lightly with a vindictive forefinger, ringing totals on cash registers.

            "   This night, I thought, is lunatic! All about me, wives, hilarious with contempt, hysterical at being so shabbily revealed in their national pastimes, gagged for air. Their husbands sat stunned, as if a war were over that had not been declared, fought and lost before they could move. Each, nearby, had the terrible look of a man who fears his throat is cut, and that a sneeze would fill the aisle with heads .\n",
            "   Quickly! I thought. Do something!\n",

            "   Too late. His forty-dollar pen was gone. He didnt know it. She tweaked his nose. He smiled. Idiot! There went his wallet. Not your nose, fool, your coat!\n",
            "   “Padded?” She pinched his shoulder. He looked at his right arm. No! I cried silently, for now she had the letters out of his left coat pocket. She planted a red kiss on his brow and backed off with everything else he had on him, coins, identification, a package of chocolates which she ate, greedily. Use the sense God gave a cow! I shouted behind my face. Blind! See what shes doing!\n",
            "   She whirled him round, measured him, and said, “This yours?” and returned his tie.\n",
            "   My wife was hysterical. She still held the glasses fixed on every nuance and vibration of loss and deprivation on the poor idiots face. Her mouth was spoiled with triumph.\n",
            "   My God! I cried in the uproar. Get off the stage! I yelled within, wishing I could really yell it. At least get out while you have some pride!\n",
            "   The laughter had erupted a volcano in the theater, high and rumbling and dark. The dim grotto seemed lit with unhealthy fever, an incandescence. My twin wanted to break off, like one of Pavlovs dogs, too many bells on too many days: no reward, no food. His eyes were glazed with his insane predicament.\n",
            "   Fall! Jump in the pit! Crawl away! I thought.\n",
            "   The orchestra sawed at destiny with violins and Valkyrian trumpets in full flood.\n",
            "   With one last snatch, one last contemptuous wag of her body, Miss Quick grasped my twins clean white shirt, and yanked it off.\n",
            "   She threw the shirt in the air. As it fell, so did his pants As his pants fell, unbelted, so did the theater. An avalanche of shock soared to bang the rafters and roll over us in echoes a thundering hilarity.\n",
            "   The curtain fell.\n",
            "   We sat, covered with unseen rubble. Drained of blood, buried in one upheaval after another, degraded and autopsied and, minus eulogy, tossed into a mass grave, we men took a minute to stare at that dropped curtain, behind which hid the pickpocket and her victims, behind which a man quickly hoisted his trousers up his spindly legs.\n",
            "   A burst of applause, a prolonged tide on a dark shore. Miss Quick did not appear to bow. She did not need to. She was standing behind the curtain. I could feel her there, no smile, no expression. Standing, coldly estimating the caliber of the applause, comparing it to the metered remembrances of other nights.\n",
            "   I jumped up in an absolute rage. I had, after all, failed myself. When I should have ducked, I bobbed; when I should have backed off, I ran in. What an ass!\n",
            "   “What a fine show!” said my wife as we milled through the departing audience.\n",

            "   “Didnt you like it?”\n",
            "   “All except the pickpocket. Obvious act, overdone, no subtlety,” I said, lighting a cigarette.\n",

            "   “This way.” I steered my wife toward the stage door.\n",
            "   “Of course,” said my wife blandly, “that man, the one who looks like you, he was a plant. They call them shills, dont they? Paid by the management to pretend to be part of the audience?”\n",
            "   “No man would take money for a spectacle like that,” I said. “No, he was just some boob who didnt know how to be careful.”\n",
            "   “What are we doing back here?”\n",
            "   Blinking around, we found we were backstage.\n",
            "   Perhaps I wished to stride up to my twin, shouting, “Half-baked ox! Insulter of all men! Play a flute: you dance. Tickle your chin: you jump like a puppet! Jerk!”\n",
            "   The truth was, of course, I must see my twin close-up, confront the traitor and see where his true flesh differed from mine. After all, wouldnt I have done better in his place?!\n",
            "   The backstage was lit in blooms and isolated flushes, now bright, now dark, where the other magicians stood chatting. And there, there was Miss Quick!\n",
            "   And there, smiling, was my twin!\n",
            "   “You did fine, Charlie,” said Miss Quick.\n",
            "   My twins name was Charlie. Stupid name.\n",
            "   Charlie patted Miss Quicks cheek. “You did fine, maam!”\n",
            "   God, it was true! A shill, a confederate. Paid what? Five, ten dollars for letting his shirt be torn oft, letting his pants drop with his pride? What a turncoat, traitor!\n",
            "   I stood, glaring.\n",
            "   He glanced up.\n",
            "   Perhaps he saw me.\n",
            "   Perhaps some bit of my rage and impacted sorrow reached him.\n",
            "   He held my gaze for only a moment, his mouth wide, as if he had just seen an old school chum. But, not remembering my name, could not call out, so let the moment pass.\n",
            "   He saw my rage. His face paled. His smile died. He glanced quickly away. He did not look up again, but stood pretending to listen to Miss Quick, who was laughing and talking with the other magicians.\n",
            "   I stared at him and stared again. Sweat oiled his face. My hate melted. My temper cooled. I saw his profile clearly, his chin, eyes, nose, hairline; I memorized it all. Then I heard someone say:\n",
            "   “It was a fine show!”\n",
            "   My wife, moving forward, shook the hand of the pickpocketing beast.\n",
            "   On the street, I said, “Well, Im satisfied.”\n",
            "   “About what?” asked my wife.\n",
            "   “He doesnt look like me at all. Chins too sharp. Nose is smaller. Lower lip isnt full enough. Too much eyebrow. Onstage, far oft, had me going. But close up, no, no. It was the crew cut and horn-rims fooled us. Anyone could have horn-rims and a crew cut.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” my wife agreed, “anyone.”\n",
            "   As she climbed into our car, I could not help but admire her long, lovely legs.\n",
            "   Driving off, I thought I glimpsed that familiar face in the passing crowd. The face, however, was watching me. I wasnt sure. Resemblances, I now knew, are superficial.\n",
            "   The face vanished in the crowd.\n",
            "   “Ill never forget,” said my wife, “when his pants-fell!” I drove very fast, then drove very slow, all the way home.\n",

The young men were all staring down the long bar at us and then, as if unable to pull their gaze away, at themselves. You could almost hear their cries of appreciation. And with each cry, they grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful...\n",

            "   “I think its time to leave,” I said.\n",
            "   “Nonsense. Come. No one will see you. Theyre all... busy. I am Moses,” said the sweet breath at my elbow. “And I hereby tell the Red Sea to part!”\n",
            "   And we moved along a path between two tides, each shadowed, each more terrifying with its gasps, its cries, its slip-pages of flesh, its slapping like waves, its repeated whispers for more, more, ah, God, more!\n",
            "   I ran, but my host grabbed on. “Look right, left, now right again!”\n",
            "   There must have been a hundred, two hundred animals, beasts, no, men wrestling, leaping, falling, rolling in darkness. It was a sea of flesh, undulant, a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats, a glistening of skin, flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes, spun on leather horses, or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of lamentations and muffled cries. I stared across an ocean of rising and falling shapes. My ears were scorched by their bestial moans.\n",
            "   “What, my God,” I exclaimed, “does it all mean?”\n",
            "   “There. See.”\n",
            "   And above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window, forty feet wide and ten feet tall, and behind that cold glass Something watching, savoring, alert, one vast stare.\n",
            "   And over all there was the suction of a great breath, a vast inhalation which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible need. As the shadows tumbled and writhed, this inhalation tugged at them and the raw air in my nostrils. Somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked in darkness but did not exhale. There were long pauses as the shadows flailed and fell, and then another savoring inhalation. It swallowed breath. In, in, always in, devouring the sweaty air, hungering the passions.\n",
            "   And the shadows were pulled, I was pulled, toward that vast glass eye, that immense window behind which a shapeless Something stared to dine on gymnasium airs.\n",
            "   “Dorian?” I guessed.\n",
            "   “Come meet him.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but...” I watched the wild, convulsive shadows. “What are they doing?”\n",
            "   “Go find out. Afraid? Cowards never live. So!”\n",
            "   He swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive, I could not feel, for suddenly I lurched into a hothouse as the door slammed and was locked by my blond young friend. “Ready?”\n",
            "   “Lord, I must go home!”\n",
            "   “Not until you meet,” said my host, “him.”\n",
            "   He pointed. At first I could see nothing. The lights were dim and the place, like the gymnasium, was mostly shadow. I smelled jungle greens. The air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes. I smelled papaya and mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an unseen tide. But the tide was there with that immense inhaled breathing that rose and was quiet and began again.\n",
            "   “I see no one,” I said.\n",
            "   “Let your eyes adjust. Wait.”\n",
            "   I waited. I watched.\n",
            "   There were no chairs in the room, for there was no need of chairs.\n",
            "   He did not sit, he did not recline, he “prolonged” himself on the largest bed in history. The dimensions might easily have been fifteen feet by twenty. It reminded me of the apartment of a writer I once knew who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs.\n",
            "   So it was with this nest, with Dorian, immense, a gelatinous skin, a vitreous shape, undulant within that nest.\n",
            "   And if Dorian was male or female, I could not guess. This was a great pudding, an emperor jellyfish, a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from the exterior of which, on occasion, noxious gases escaped with rubbery sounds; great lips sibilating. That and the sough of that labored pump, that constant inhalation, were the only sounds within the chamber as I stood, anxious, alarmed, but at last impressed by this beached creature, cast up from a dark landfall. The thing was a gelatinous cripple, an octopus without limbs, an amphibian stranded, unable to undulate and seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay, featureless, with a mere x-ray ghost of legs, arms, wrists, and hands with skeletal fingers. At last I could discern, at the far end of this flesh peninsula, what seemed a half-flat face with a frail phantom of skull beneath, an open fissure for an eye, a ravenous nostril, and a red wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth.\n",
            "   And at last this thing, this Dorian, spoke.\n",
            "   Or whispered, or lisped.\n",
            "   And with each lisp, each sibilance, an odor of decay was expelled as if from a vast night-swamp balloon, sunk on its side, lost in fetid water as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks. It expelled but one lingering syllable:\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   Yes what?\n",
            "   And then it added:\n",
            "   Soooo...\n",
            "   “How long... how long,” I murmured, “has it... has he been here?”\n",
            "   “No one knows. When Victoria was Queen? When Booth emptied his makeup kit to load his pistol? When Napoleon yellow-stained the Moscow snows? Forevers not bad .\n",
            "   What else?”\n",
            "   I swallowed hard. “Is... is he?”\n",
            "   “Dorian? Dorian of the attic? He of the Portrait? And somewhere along the line found portraits not enough? Oil, canvas, no depth. The world needed something that could soak in, sponge the midnight rains, breakfast and lunch on loss, depravitys guilt. Something to truly take in, drink, digest; a pustule, imperial intestine. A rheum oesophagus for sin. A laboratory plate to take bacterial snows. Dorian.”\n",
            "   The long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and valves, and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the aqueous gels.\n",
            "   A slit widened to emit gas and again the single word:\n",
            "   Yessss .\n",
            "   “Hes welcoming you!” My host smiled.\n",
            "   “I know, I know,” I said impatiently. “But why? I dont even want to be here. Im ill. Why cant we go?”\n",
            "   “Because”-my host laughed-“you were selected.\n",
            "   “Selected?”\n",
            "   “Weve had our eye on you.”\n",
            "   “You mean youve watched, followed, spied on me? Christ, who gave you permission?”\n",
            "   “Temper, temper. Not everyone is picked.”\n",
            "   “Who said I wanted to be picked!?”\n",
            "   “If you could see yourself as we see you, youd know why.”\n",
            "   I turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it stare. Then all its apertures sealed: the saber-cut mouth, the slitted nostrils, the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless. The sibilance pumped with gaseous suctions.\n",
            "   Yessss, it whispered.\n",
            "   Lisssst, it murmured.\n",
            "   “And list it is!” My host pulled forth a small computer pad which he tapped to screen my name, address, and phone.\n",
            "   He glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me.\n",
            "   “Single,” he said.\n",
            "   “Married and divorced.”\n",
            "   “Now single! No women in your life?”\n",
            "   “Im walking wounded.”\n",
            "   He tapped his pad. “Visiting strange bars.”\n",
            "   “I hadnt noticed.”\n",
            "   “Creative blindness. Getting to bed late. Sleeping all day. Drinking heavily three nights a week.”\n",
            "   “Twice!”\n",
            "   “Going to the gym, look, every day. Workouts excessive. Prolonged steam baths, overlong massages. Sudden interest in sports. Endless basketball, soccer, tennis matches every night, and half the noons. Thats hyperventilation!”\n",
            "   “My business!”\n",
            "   “And ours! Youre balanced giddily on the rim. Shove all these facts in that one-armed bandit in your head, yank, and watch the lemons and ripe cherries spin. Yank!”\n",
            "   Jesus God. Yes! Bars. Drinks. Late nights. Gyms. Saunas. Masseurs. Basketball. Tennis. Soccer. Yank. Pull. Spin!\n",
            "   “Well?” My host searched my face, amused. “Three jackpot cherries in a row?”\n",
            "   I shuddered.\n",
            "   “Circumstance. No court would convict me.”\n",
            "   “This court elects you. We tell palms to read ravenous groins. Yes?”\n",
            "   Gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless mound. Yessss.\n",
            "   They say that men in the grip of passion, blind to their own darkness, make love and run mad. Stunned by guilt, they find themselves beasts, having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church, town, parents, life. In explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure. Seeing her as unholy provocateur, they kill. Women, in similar rages and guilts, overdose. Eve lies self-slain in the Garden. Adam hangs himself with the Snake as noose.\n",
            "   But here was no passionate crime, no woman, no provocateur, only the great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host. And only words which riddled me with fusillades of arrows. Like an Oriental hedgehog, bristled with shafts, my body exploded with No, No, No. Echoed and then real:\n",
            "   “No!”\n",
            "   Yessss, whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue, the skeleton buried in ancient soups.\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   I gasped to see my games, steams, midnight bars, late-dawn beds: a maniac sum.\n",
            "   I rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked, creased, and oiled by passion, so cobwebbed and smashed by drink, that I tried to avert my gaze. The terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand. Stupidly, I reached to shake his and-rapped glass! A mirror. I stared deep into my own life. I had seen myself in shop windows, dim undersea men running in creeks. Mornings, shaving, I saw my mirrored health. But this! This troglodyte trapped in amber. Myself, snapshotted like ten dozen sexual acrobats! And who jammed this mirror at me? My beautiful host, and that corrupt flatulence beyond.\n",
            "   “You are selected,” they whispered.\n",
            "   “I refuse!” I shrieked.\n",
            "   And whether I shrieked aloud or merely thought, a great furnace gaped. The oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous streams. My beautiful host fell back, stunned that their search beneath my skin, behind my mask, had brought revulsion. Always when Dorian cried, “Friend,” raw gymnast teams had mobbed to catapult that armless, legless, featureless Sargasso Sea. Before they had smothered to drown in his miasma, to arise, embrace, and wrestle in the dark gymnasium, then run forth young to assault a world.\n",
            "   And I? What had I dared to do, that quaked that membranous sac into regurgitated whistling and broken winds?\n",
            "   “Idiot!” cried my host, all teeth and fists. “Out! Out!”\n",
            "   “Out,” I cried, spun to obey, and tripped.\n",
            "   I do not clearly know what happened as I fell. And if it was a swift reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that putrescent mound, I cannot say. I knew no lightning shock of murder, yet knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge. For what? I thought. What are you to Dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face, or causes the slightest twitch of leg, arm, hand, or fingernail, as the last fetid air from Dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils.\n",
            "   It was over in a second.\n",
            "   Something shoved me. Did my secret self, insulted, give that push? I was flung as if on wires, knocked to sprawl at Dorian.\n",
            "   He gave two terrible cries, one of warning, one of despair.\n",
            "   I was recovered so in landing, I did not sink my hands deep in that poisonous yeast, into that multiflorid Man of War jelly. I swear that I touched, raked, scarified him with only one thing: the smallest fingernail of my right hand.\n",
            "   My fingernail!\n",
            "   And so this Dorian was shot and foundered. And so the mammoth with screams collapsed. And so the nauseous balloon sank, fold on midnight fold, upon its own boneless sell, fissuring volcanic sulfurs, immense rectal airs, outgassed whistles, and whimpers of self-pitying despair.\n",
            "   “Christ! What have you done!? Murderer! Damn you!” cried my host, riven to stare at Dorians exhaustions unto death.\n",
            "   He whirled to strike, but ran to reach the door and cry, “Lock this! Lock! Whatever happens, for Gods sake, dont open! Now!” The door slammed. I ran to lock it and turn.\n",
            "   Quietly, Dorian was falling away.\n",
            "   He sank down and down, out of sight. Like a great membranous tent with its poles removed, he vanished into the floor, down flues and vents on all sides of his great platform nest. Vents obviously created for such a massive disease-sac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas. Even as I watched, the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents, and I stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable strata of discards and half-born fetuses had lain sucking at sins, spoiled bones, and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty. That perverse royalty, that lunatic monarch, gone, all gone. A last choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death.\n",
            "   My God, I thought, even now, that, all that, that terrible miasma, that stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on clean shores where bathers come at dawn... \n",
            "   Even now... \n",
            "   I stood, eyes shut, waiting.\n",
            "   For what? There had to be a  thing, yes? It came.\n",
            "   There was a trembling, shivering, and then a quaking of the wall, but especially the golden door behind me.\n",
            "   I spun to see as well as hear.\n",
            "   I saw the door shaken, and then bombarded from the other side. Fists pummeled, struck, hammered. Voices cried out and screamed and then shrieked.\n",
            "   I felt a great mass ram the door to shiver, to slam it on its hinges.\n",
            "   I stared, fearful that the door might explode and let in the flood tide of nightmare-ravening, terrified beasts, the kennel of dying things. For now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape, to beg for mercy, were so terrible that I clamped my fists to my ears.\n",
            "   Dorian was gone, but they remained. Shrieks. Screams. Screams. Shrieks. An avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell, yammering.\n",
            "   What must they look like now? I thought. All those bouquets. All those beauties.\n",
            "   The police will come, I thought, soon. But .\n",
            "   No matter what... \n",
            "   I would not unlock that door.\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "NO NEWS, OR WHAT KILLED THE DOG?\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was a day of holocausts, cataclysms, tornadoes, earth-quakes, blackouts, mass murders, eruptions, and miscellaneous dooms, at the peak of which the sun swallowed the earth and the stars vanished.\n",
            "   But to put it simply, the most respected member of the Bentley family up and died.\n",
            "   Dog was his name, and dog he was.\n",
            "   The Bentleys, arising late Saturday morning, found Dog stretched on the kitchen floor, his head toward Mecca, his paws neatly folded, his tail not a-thump but silent for the first time in twenty years.\n",
            "   Twenty years! My God, everyone thought, could it really have been that long? And now, without permission, Dog was cold and gone.\n",
            "   Susan, the younger daughter, woke everyone yelling:\n",
            "   “Somethings wrong with Dog. Quick!”\n",
            "   Without bothering to don his bathrobe, Roger Bentley, in his underwear, hurried out to look at that quiet beast on the\n",
            "   kitchen tiles. His wife, Ruth, followed, and then their son Skip, twelve. The rest of the family, married and flown, Rodney and Sal, would arrive later. Each in turn would say the same thing:\n",
            "   “No! Dog was forever.”\n",
            "   Dog said nothing, but lay there like World War II, freshly finished, and a devastation.\n",
            "   Tears poured down Susans cheeks, then down Ruth Bentleys, followed in good order by tears from Father and, at last, when it had sunk in, Skip.\n",
            "   Instinctively, they made a ring around Dog, kneeling to the floor to touch him, as if this might suddenly make him sit up, smile as he always did at his food, bark, and beat them to the door. But their touching did nothing but increase their tears.\n",
            "   But at last they rose, hugged each other, and went blindly in search of breakfast, in the midst of which Ruth Bentley said, stunned, “We cant just leave him there.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley picked Dog up, gently, and moved him out on the patio, in the shade, by the pool.\n",
            "   “What do we do ?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Roger Bentley. “This is the first death in the family in years and—” He stopped, snorted, and shook his head. “I mean—”\n",
            "   “You meant exactly what you said,” said Ruth Bentley. “If Dog wasnt family, he was nothing. God, I loved him.”\n",
            "   A fresh burst of tears ensued, during which Roger Bentley brought a blanket to put over Dog, but Susan stopped him.\n",
            "   “No, no. 1 want to see him. I wont be able to see him ever again. Hes so beautiful. Hes so—old.”\n",
            "   They all carried their breakfasts out on the patio to sit around Dog, somehow feeling they couldnt ignore him by eating inside.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley telephoned his other children, whose response, after the first tears, was the same: theyd be right over. Wait.\n",
            "   When the other children arrived, first Rodney, twenty-one, and then the older daughter, Sal, twenty-four, a fresh storm of grief shook everyone and then they sat silently for a moment, watching Dog for a miracle.\n",
            "   “What are your plans?” asked Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “I know this is silly,” said Roger Bentley after an embarrassed pause. “After all, hes only a dog—”\n",
            "   “Only!?” cried everyone instantly.\n",
            "   Roger had to back off. “Look, he deserves the Taj Mahal. What hell get is the Orion Pet Cemetery over in Burbank.”\n",
            "   “Pet Cemetery!?” cried everyone, but each in a different way.\n",
            "   “My God,” said Rodney, “thats silly!”\n",
            "   “Whats so silly about it?” Skips face reddened and his lip trembled. “Dog, why, Dog was a pearl of... rare price.\n",
            "   “Yeah!” added Susan.\n",
            "   “Well, pardon me.” Roger Bentley turned away to look at the pool, the bushes, the sky. “I suppose I could call those trash people who pick up dead bodies—”\n",
            "   “Trash people?” exclaimed Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Dead bodies?” said Susan. “Dog isnt a dead body!”\n",
            "   “What is he, then?” asked Skip bleakly.\n",
            "   They all stared at Dog lying quietly there by the pool. “Hes,” blurted Susan at last, “hes... hes my love!” Before the crying could start again, Roger Bentley picked up the patio telephone, dialed the Pet Cemetery, talked, and put the phone down.\n",
            "   “Two hundred dollars,” he informed everyone. “Not bad.”\n",
            "   “For Dog?” said Skip. “Not enough!”\n",
            "   “Are you really serious about this?” asked Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Yeah,” said Roger. “Ive made fun of those places all my life. But, now, seeing as how well never be able to visit Dog again—” He let a moment pass. “Theyll come take Dog at noon. Services tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Services!” Snorting, Rodney stalked to the rim of the pool and waved his arms. “You wont get me to that!”\n",
            "   Everyone stared. Rodney turned at last and let his shoulders slump. “Hell, Ill be there.”\n",
            "   “Dog would never forgive you if you didnt.” Susan snuffed and wiped her nose.\n",
            "   But Roger Bentley had heard none of this. Staring at Dog, then his family, and up to the sky, he shut his eyes and exhaled a great whisper:\n",
            "   “Oh, my God!” he said, eyes shut. “Do you realize that this is the first terrible thing thats happened to our family? Have we ever been sick, gone to the hospital? Been in an accident?”\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   “No,” said everyone.\n",
            "   “Gosh,” said Skip.\n",
            "   “Gosh, indeed! You sure as hell notice accidents, sickness, hospitals.”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” said Susan, and had to stop and wait because her voice broke. “Maybe Dog died just to make us notice how lucky we are.”\n",
            "   “Lucky?!” Roger Bentley opened his eyes and turned. “Yes! You know what we are—”\n",
            "   “The science fiction generation,” offered Rodney, lighting a cigarette casually.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You rave on about that, your school lectures, or during dinner. Can openers? Science fiction. Automobiles. Radio, TV, films. Everything! So science fiction!”\n",
            "   “Well, dammit, they are!” cried Roger Bentley and went to stare at Dog, as if the answers were there amongst the last departing fleas. “Hell, not so long ago there were no cars, can openers, TV. Someone had to dream them. Start of lecture. Someone had to build them. Mid-lecture. So science fiction dreams became finished science fact. Lecture finis!”\n",
            "   “I bet!” Rodney applauded politely.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley could only sink under the weight of his sons irony to stroke the dear dead beast.\n",
            "   “Sorry. Dog bit me. Cant help myself. Thousands of years, all we did is die. Now, that times over. In sum: science fiction.”\n",
            "   “Bull.” Rodney laughed. “Stop reading that junk, Dad.”\n",
            "   “Junk?” Roger touched Dogs muzzle. “Sure. But how about Lister, Pasteur, Salk? Hated death. Jumped to stop it. Thats all science fiction was ever about. Hating the way things are, wanting to make things different. Junk?!”\n",
            "   “Ancient history, Pop.”\n",
            "   “Ancient?” Roger Bentley fixed his son with a terrible eye. “Christ. When I was born in 1920, if you wanted to visit your family on Sundays you—”\n",
            "   “Went to the graveyard?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Yes. My brother and sister died when I was seven. Half of my family gone! Tell me, dear children, how many of your friends died while you were growing up. In grammar school? High school?”\n",
            "   He included the family in his gaze, and waited.\n",
            "   “None,” said Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “None! You hear that? None! Christ. Six of my best friends died by the time I was ten! Wait! I just remembered!”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley hurried to rummage in a hall closet and brought out an old 78-rpm record into the sunlight, blowing off the dust. He squinted at the label:\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?”\n",
            "   Everyone came to look at the ancient disc.\n",
            "   “Hey, how old is that?”\n",
            "   “Heard it a hundred times when I was a kid in the twenties,” said Roger.\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?” Sal glanced at her fathers face.\n",
            "   “This gets played at Dogs funeral,” he said.\n",
            "   “Youre not serious?” said Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   Just then the doorbell rang.\n",
            "   “That cant be the Pet Cemetery people come to take Dog-?”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Susan. “Not so soon!”\n",
            "   Instinctively, the family formed a wall between Dog and the doorbell sound, holding off eternity.\n",
            "   Then they cried, one more time.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The strange and wonderful thing about the funeral was how many people came.\n",
            "   “I didnt know Dog had so many friends,” Susan blubbered.\n",
            "   “He freeloaded all around town,” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Speak kindly of the dead.”\n",
            "   “Well, he did, dammit., Otherwise why is Bill Johnson here, or Gert Skall, or Jim across the street?”\n",
            "   “Dog,” said Roger Bentley, “I sure wish you could see this.”\n",
            "   “He does.” Susans eyes welled over. “Wherever he is.”\n",
            "   “Good old Sue,” whispered Rodney, “who cries at telephone books—”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” cried Susan.\n",
            "   “Hush, both of you.”\n",
            "   And Roger Bentley moved, eyes down, toward the front of the small funeral parlor where Dog was laid out, head on paws, in a box that was neither too rich nor too simple but just right.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley placed a steel needle down on the black record which turned on top of a flake-painted portable phonograph. The needle scratched and hissed. All the neighbors leaned forward.\n",
            "   “No funeral oration,” said Roger quickly. “Just this .. And a voice spoke on a day long ago and told a story about a man who returned from vacation to ask friends what had happened while he was gone.\n",
            "   It seemed that nothing whatsoever had happened. Oh, just one thing. Everyone wondered what had killed the dog.\n",
            "   The dog? asked the vacationer. My dog died? Yes, and maybe it was the burned horseflesh did it. Burned horseflesh!? cried the vacationer. Well, said his informant, when the barn burned, the horseflesh caught fire, so the dog ate the burned horseflesh, died.\n",
            "   The barn!? cried the vacationer. How did it catch fire? Well, sparks from the house blew over, torched the barn, burned the horseflesh, dog ate them, died.\n",
            "   Sparks from the house!? shouted the vacationer. How-?\n",
            "   It was the curtains in the house, caught fire.\n",
            "   Curtains? Burned!?\n",
            "   From the candles around the coffin.\n",
            "   Coffin!?\n",
            "   Your aunts funeral coffin, candles there caught the curtains, house burned, sparks from the house flew over, burned down the barn, dog ate the burned horseflesh-In sum: no news, or what killed the dog!\n",
            "   The record hissed and stopped.\n",
            "   In the silence, there was a little quiet laughter, even though the record had been about dogs and people dying.\n",
            "   “Now, do we get the lecture?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “No, a sermon.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley put his hands on the pulpit to stare for long moments at notes he hadnt made.\n",
            "   “I dont know if were here for Dog or ourselves. Both, I suppose. Were the nothing-ever-happened-to-us people. Today is a first. Not that I want a rush of doom or disease. God forbid. Death, come slowly, please.”\n",
            "   He turned the phonograph record round and round in his hands, trying to read the words under the grooves.\n",
            "   “No news. Except the aunts funeral candles catch the curtains, sparks fly, and the dog goes west. In our lives, just the opposite. No news for years. Good livers, healthy hearts, good times. So-whats it all about?”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley glanced at Rodney, who was checking his wristwatch.\n",
            "   “Someday we must die, also.” Roger Bentley hurried on. “Hard to believe. Were spoiled. But Susan was right. Dog died to tell us this, gently, and we must believe. And at the same time celebrate. What? The fact that were the start of an amazing, dumbfounding history of survival that will only get better as the centuries pass. You may argue that the  war will take us all. Maybe.\n",
            "   “I can only say I think you will grow to be old, very old people. Ninety years from now, most people will have cured hearts, stopped cancers, and jumped life cycles. A lot of sadness will have gone out of the world, thank God. Will this be easy to do? No. Will we do it? Yes. Not in all countries, right off. But, finally, in most.\n",
            "   “As I said yesterday, fifty years ago, if you wanted to\n",
            "   visit your aunts, uncles, grandparents, brothers, sisters, the graveyard was it. Death was all the talk. You had to talk it. Times up, Rodney?”\n",
            "   Rodney signaled his father he had one last minute.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley wound it down:\n",
            "   “Sure, kids still die. But not millions. Old folks? Wind up in Sun City instead of marble Orchard.”\n",
            "   The father surveyed his family, bright-eyed, in the pews.\n",
            "   “God, look at you! Then look back. A thousand centuries of absolute terror, absolute grief. How parents stayed sane to raise their kids when half of them died, damned if I know. Yet with broken hearts, they did. While millions died of flu or the Plague.\n",
            "   “So here we are in a new time that we cant see because we stand in the eye of the hurricane, where everythings calm.\n",
            "   “Ill shut up now, with a last word for Dog. Because we loved him, weve done this almost silly thing, this service, but now suddenly were not ashamed or sorry we bought him a plot or had me speak. We may never come visit him, who can say? But he has a place. Dog, old boy, bless you. Now, everyone, blow your nose.”\n",
            "   Everyone blew his nose.\n",
            "   “Dad,” said Rodney suddenly, “could-we hear the record again?”\n",
            "   Everyone looked at Rodney, surprised.\n",
            "   “Just,” said Roger Bentley, “what I was going to suggest.”\n",
            "   He put the needle on the record. It hissed.\n",
            "   About a minute in, when the sparks from the house flew over to burn the barn and torch the horseflesh and kill the dog, there was a sound at the back doorway to the small parlor.\n",
            "   Everyone turned.\n",
            "   A strange man stood in the door holding a small wicker basket from which came familiar, small yapping sounds.\n",
            "   And even as the flames from the candles around the coffin caught the curtains and the last sparks blew on the wind\n",
            "   The whole family, drawn out into the sunlight, gathered around the stranger with the wicker basket, waiting for Father to arrive to throw back the coverlet on the small carrier so they could all dip their hands in.\n",
            "   That moment, as Susan said later, was like reading the telephone book one more time.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "THE WITCH DOCTOR\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was a pounding on a door, a furious, frantic, insistent pounding, born of hysteria and fear and a great desire to be heard, to be freed, to be let loose, to escape. It was a wrenching at hidden paneling, it was a hollow knocking, a rapping, a testing, a clawing! It was a scratching at hollow boards, a ripping at bedded nails; it was a muffled closet shouting and demanding, far away, and a call to be noticed, followed by a silence.\n",
            "   The silence was the most empty and terrible of all. Robert and Martha Webb sat up in bed.\n",
            "   “Did you hear it?”\n",
            "   “Yes, again.”\n",
            "   “Downstairs.”\n",
            "   Now whoever it was who had pounded and rapped and made his fingers raw, drawn blood with his fever and quest to be free, had drawn into silence, listening himself to see if his terror and drumming had summoned any help.\n",
            "   The winter night lay through the house with a falling-snow silence, silence snowing into every room, drifting over tables and floors, and banking up the stairwell.\n",
            "   Then the pounding started again. And then:\n",
            "   A sound of soft crying.\n",
            "   “Downstairs.”\n",
            "   “Someone in the house.”\n",
            "   “Lotte, do you think? The front doors unlocked.”\n",
            "   “Shed have knocked. Cant be Lotte.”\n",
            "   “Shes the only one it could be. She phoned.”\n",
            "   They both glanced at the phone. If you lifted the receiver, you heard a winter stillness. The phones were dead. They had died days ago with the riots in the nearest towns and cities. Now, in the receiver, you heard only your own heart-beat. “Can you put me up?” Lone had cried from six hundred miles away. “Just overnight?”\n",
            "   But before they could answer her, the phone had filled itself with long miles of silence.\n",
            "   “Lotte is coming. She sounded hysterical. That might be her,” said Martha Webb.\n",
            "   “No,” said Robert. “I heard that crying other nights, too. Dear God.”\n",
            "   They lay in the cold room in this farmhouse back in the Massachusetts wilderness, back from the main roads, away from the towns, near a bleak river and a black forest. It was the frozen middle of December. The white smell of snow cut the air.\n",
            "   They arose. With an oil lamp lit, they sat on the edge of the bed as if dangling their legs over a precipice.\n",
            "   “Theres no one downstairs, there cant be.”\n",
            "   “Whoever it is sounds frightened.”\n",
            "   “Were all frightened, damn it. Thats why we came out here, to be away from cities, riots, all that damned foolishness. No more wiretaps, arrests, taxes, neurotics. Now when we find it at last, people call and upset us. And tonight this, Christ!” He glanced at his wife. “You afraid?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont believe in ghosts. This is 1999; Im sane. Or like to think I am. Wheres your gun?”\n",
            "   “We wont need it. Dont ask me why, but we wont.” They picked up their oil lamps. In another month the small power plant would be finished in the white barns behind the house and thered be power to spare, but now they haunted the farm, coming and going with dim lamps or candles.\n",
            "   They stood at the stairwell, both thirty-three, both immensely practical.\n",
            "   The crying, the sadness, and the plea came from below in the winter rooms.\n",
            "   “She sounds so damned sad,” said Robert. “God, Im sorry for her, but dont even know who it is. Come on.”\n",
            "   They went downstairs.\n",
            "   As if hearing their footsteps, the crying grew louder. There was a dull thudding against a hidden panel somewhere.\n",
            "   “The Witch Door!” said Martha Webb at last.\n",
            "   “Cant be.”\n",
            "   “Is.”\n",
            "   They stood in the long hall looking at that place under the stairs, where the panels trembled faintly. But now the cries faded, as if the crier was exhausted, or something had diverted her, or perhaps their voices had startled her and she was listening for them to speak again. Now the winter-night house was silent and the man and wife waited with the oil lamps quietly fuming in their hands.\n",
            "   Robert Webb stepped to the Witch Door and touched it, probing for the hidden button, the secret spring. “There cant be anyone in there,” he said. “My God, weve been here six months, and thats just a cubby. Isnt that what the Realtor said when he sold the place? No one could hide in there and us not know it. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen!”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",
            "   “Shes gone, its gone, whatever it was, hell, that door hasnt been opened in our lifetime. Everyones forgotten where the spring is that unlocks it. I dont think there is a door, only a loose panel, and rats” nests, thats all. The walls, scratching. Why not?” He turned to look at his wife, who was staring at the hidden place.\n",
            "   “Silly,” she said. “Good Lord, rats dont cry. That was a voice, asking to be saved. Lotte, I thought. But now I know it wasnt she, but someone else in as much trouble.”\n",
            "   Martha Webb reached out and trembled her fingertips along the beveled edge of ancient maple. “Cant we open it?”\n",
            "   “With a crowbar and hammer, tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Robert!”\n",
            "   “Dont “Oh, Robert” me. Im tired.”\n",
            "   “You cant leave her in there to—”\n",
            "   “Shes quiet now. Christ, Im exhausted. Ill come down at the crack of dawn and knock the damned thing apart, okay?”\n",
            "   “All right,” she said, and tears came to her eyes.\n",
            "   “Women,” said Robert Webb. “Oh, my God, you and Lotte, Lotte and you. If she is coming here, if she makes it, Ill have a houseful of lunatics!”\n",
            "   “Lottes fine!”\n",
            "   “Sure, but she should keep her mouth shut. It doesnt pay now to say youre Socialist, Democrat, Libertarian, Pro-Life Abortionist, Sinn Fein Fascist, Commie, any damn thing. The towns are bombed out. People are looking for scapegoats and Lotte has to shoot from the hip, get herself smeared and now, hell, on the run.”\n",
            "   “Theyll jail her if they catch her. Or kill her, yes, kill her. Were lucky to be here with our own food. Thank God we planned ahead, we saw it coming, the starvation, the massacres. We helped ourselves. Now we help Lone if she makes it through.”\n",
            "   Without answering, he turned to the stairs. “Im dead on my feet. Im tired of saving anyone. Even Lotte. But hell, if she comes through the front door, shes saved.”\n",
            "   They went up the stairs taking the lamps, advancing in an ever-moving aura of trembling white glow. The house was as silent as snow falling. “God,” he whispered. “Damn, I dont like women crying like that.”\n",
            "   It sounded like the whole world crying, he thought. The whole world dying and needing help and lonely, but what can you do? Live in a farm like this? Far off the main highway where people dont pass, away from all the stupidity and death? What can you do?\n",
            "   They left one of the lamps lit and drew the covers over their bodies and lay, listening to the wind hit the house and creak the beams and parquetry.\n",
            "   A moment later there was a cry from downstairs, a splintering crash, the sound of a door flung wide, a bursting out of air, footsteps rapping all the rooms, a sobbing, almost an exultation, then the front door banged open, the winter wind blowing wildly in, footsteps across the front porch and gone.\n",
            "   “There!” cried Martha. “Yes!”\n",
            "   With the lamp they were down the stairs swiftly. Wind smothered their faces as they turned now toward the Witch Door, opened wide, still on its hinges, then toward the front door where they cast their light out upon a snowing winter darkness and saw nothing but white and hills, no moon, and in the lamplight the soft drift and moth-flicker of snowflakes falling from the sky to the mattressed yard.\n",
            "   “Gone,” she whispered.\n",
            "   “Who?”\n",
            "   “Well never know, unless she comes back.”\n",
            "   “She wont. Look.”\n",
            "   They moved the lamplight toward the white earth and the tiny footprints going off, across the softness, toward the dark forest.\n",
            "   “It was a woman, then. But... why?”\n",
            "   “God knows. Why anything, now in this crazy world?” They stood looking at the footprints a long while until, shivering, they moved back through the hall to the open Witch Door. They poked the lamp into this hollow under the stairs.\n",
            "   “Lord, its just a cell, hardly a closet, and look...”\n",
            "   Inside stood a small rocking chair, a braided rug, a used candle in a copper holder, and an old, worn Bible. The place smelled of must and moss and dead flowers.\n",
            "   “Is this where they used to hide people?”\n",
            "   “Yes. A long time back they hid people called witches. Trials, witch trials. They hung or burned some.”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes,” they both murmured, staring into the incredibly small cell.\n",
            "   “And the witches hid here while the hunters searched the house and gave up and left?”\n",
            "   “Yes, oh, my God, yes,” he whispered.\n",
            "   “Rob\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   She bent forward. Her face was pale and she could not look away from the small, worn rocking chair and the faded Bible.\n",
            "   “Rob. How old? This house, how old?”\n",
            "   “Maybe three hundred years.\n",
            "   “That old?”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “Crazy. Stupid...\n",
            "   “Crazy?”\n",
            "   “Houses, old like this. All the years. And more years and more after that. God, feel! If you put your hand in, yes? Would you feel it change, silly, and what if I sat in that rocking chair and shut the door, what? That woman... how long was she in there? Howd she get there? From way, way back. Wouldnt it be strange?”\n",
            "   “Bull!”\n",
            "   “But if you wanted to run away badly enough, wished for it, prayed for it, and people ran after you, and someone hid you in a place like this, a witch behind a door, and heard the searchers run through the house, closer and closer, wouldnt you want to get away? Anywhere? To another place? Why not another time? And then, in a house like this, a house so old nobody knows, if you wanted and asked for it enough, couldnt you run to another year! Maybe”-she paused-“here...?”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he muttered. “Really stupid!”\n",
            "   But still, some quiet motion within the closeted space caused both, at almost the same instant, to hold their hands out on the air, curious, like people testing invisible waters. The air seemed to move one way and then another, now warm, now cold, with a pulsation of light and a sudden turning toward dark. All this they thought but could not say. There was weather here, now a quick touch of summer and then a winter cold, which could not be, of course, but there it was. Passing along their fingertips, but unseen by their eyes, a stream of shadows and sun ran as invisible as time itself, clear as crystal, but clouded by a shifting dark. Both felt if they thrust their hands deep, they might be drawn in to drown in a mighty storm of seasons within an incredibly small space. All this, too, they thought or almost felt but could not say.\n",
            "   They seized their frozen but sunburned hands back, to stare down and hold them against the panic in their breasts.\n",
            "   “Damn,” whispered Robert Webb. “Oh, damn!” He backed off and went to open the front door again and look at the snowing night where the footprints had almost vanished.\n",
            "   “No” he said. “No, no.”\n",
            "   Just then the yellow flash of headlights on the road braked in front of the house.\n",
            "   “Lotte!” cried Martha Webb. “It must be! Lotte!” The car lights went out. They ran to meet the running woman half up the front yard.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   The woman, wild-eyed, hair windblown, threw herself at them.\n",
            "   “Martha, Bob! God, I thought Id never find you! Lost! Im being followed, lets get inside. Oh, I didnt mean to get you up in the middle of the night, its good to see you! Jesus! Hide the car! Here are the keys!”\n",
            "   Robert Webb ran to drive the car behind the house. When he came back around he saw that the heavy snowfall was already covering the tracks.\n",
            "   Then the three of them were inside the house, talking, holding onto each other. Robert Webb kept glancing at the front door.\n",
            "   “I cant thank you,” cried Lotte, huddled in a chair. “Youre at risk! I wont stay long, a few hours until its safe. Then...\n",
            "   “Stay as long as you want.”\n",
            "   “No. Theyll follow! In the cities, the fires, the murders, everyone starving, I stole gas. Do you have more? Enough to get me to Phil Merdiths in Greenborough? I—”\n",
            "   “Lotte,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “Yes?” Lotte stopped, breathless.\n",
            "   “Did you see anyone on your way up here? A woman? Running on the road?”\n",
            "   “What? I drove so fast! A woman? Yes! I almost hit her. Then she was gone! Why?”\n",
            "   “Well...\n",
            "   “Shes not dangerous?”\n",
            "   “No, no.”\n",
            "   “It is all right, my being here?”\n",
            "   “Yes, fine, fine. Sit back. Well fix some coffee—”\n",
            "   “Wait! Ill check!” And before they could stop her, Lotte ran to the front door, opened it a crack, and peered out. They stood with her and saw distant headlights flourished over a low hill and gone into a valley. “Theyre coming,” whispered Lotte. “They might search here. God, where can I hide?”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert glanced at each other.\n",
            "   No, no, thought Robert Webb. God, no! Preposterous, unimaginable, fantastic, so damned coincidental the mind raves at it, crows, hoots, guffaws! No, none of this! Get oft” circumstance! Get away with your goings and comings on not neat, or too neat, schedules. Come back, Lotte, in ten years, five years, maybe a year, a month, a week, and ask to hide. Even tomorrow show up! But dont come with coincidence in each hand like idiot children and ask, only half an hour after one terror, one miracle, to test our disbelief! Im not, after all, Charles Dickens, to blink and let this pass.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said Lotte.\n",
            "   “I—” said Robert.\n",
            "   “No place to hide me?”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “Weve a place.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “Here.” He turned slowly away, stunned.\n",
            "   They walked down the hall to the half-open paneling.\n",
            "   “This?” Lotte said. “Secret? Did you-7”\n",
            "   “No” its been here since the house was built long ago.” Lotte touched and moved the door on its hinges. “Does it work? Will they know where to look and find it?”\n",
            "   “No. Its beautifully made. Shut, you cant tell its there.” Outside in the winter night, cars rushed, their beams flashing up the road, across the house windows.\n",
            "   Lotte peered into the Witch Door as one peers down a deep, lonely well.\n",
            "   A filtering of dust moved about her. The small rocking chair trembled.\n",
            "   Moving in silently, Lotte touched the half-burned candle.\n",
            "   “Why, its still warm!”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert said nothing. They held to the Witch Door, smelling the odor of warm tallow.\n",
            "   Lotte stood rigidly in the little space, bowing her head beneath the beamed ceiling.\n",
            "   A horn blew in the snowing night. Lotte took a deep breath and said, “Shut the door.”\n",
            "   They shut the Witch Door. There was no way to tell that a door was there.\n",
            "   They blew out the lamp and stood in the cold, dark house, waiting.\n",
            "   The cars rushed down the road, their noise loud, and their yellow headlights bright in the falling snow. The wind stirred the footprints in the yard, one pair going out, another coming in, and the tracks of Lottes car fast vanishing, and at last gone.\n",
            "   “Thank God,” whispered Martha.\n",
            "   The cars, honking, whipped around the last bend and down the hill and stopped, waiting, looking in at the dark house. Then, at last, they started up away into the snow and the hills.\n",
            "   Soon their lights were gone and their sound gone with them.\n",
            "   “We were lucky,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “But shes not.”\n",
            "   “She?”\n",
            "   “That woman, whoever she was, ran out of here. Theyll find here. Somebodyll find her.”\n",
            "   “Christ, thats right.”\n",
            "   “And she has no I. D., no proof of herself. And she doesnt know whats happened to her. And when she tells them who she is and where she came from!”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes.”\n",
            "   “God help her.”\n",
            "   They looked into the snowing night but saw nothing. Everything was still. “You cant escape,” she said. “No matter what you do, no one can escape.”\n",
            "   They moved away from the window and down the hall to the Witch Door and touched it.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they called.\n",
            "   The Witch Door did not tremble or move. “Lotte, you can come out now.” There was no answer; not a breath or a whisper. Robert tapped the door. “Hey in there.” “Lotte!”\n",
            "   He knocked at the paneling, his mouth agitated. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   “Open it!”\n",
            "   “Im trying, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Lotte, well get you out, wait! Everythings all right!”\n",
            "   He beat with both fists, cursing. Then he said, “Watch\n",
            "   out!” took a step back, raised his leg, kicked once, twice, three times; vicious kicks at the paneling that crunched holes and crumbled wood into kindling. He reached in and yanked the entire paneling free. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They leaned together into the small place under the stairs. The candle flickered on the small table. The Bible was\n",
            "   gone. The small rocking chair moved quietly back and forth, in little arcs, and then stood still.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They stared at the empty room. The candle flickered.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they said.\n",
            "   “You dont believe .\n",
            "   “I dont know. Old houses are old... old...\n",
            "   “You think Lotte... she... ?”\n",
            "   “I dont know, I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Then shes safe at least, safe! Thank God!”\n",
            "   “Safe? Wheres she gone? You really think that? A woman in new clothes, red lipstick, high heels, short skirt, perfume, plucked brows, diamond rings, silk stockings, safe? Safe!” he said, staring deep into the open frame of the Witch Door.\n",
            "   “Yes, safe. Why not?”\n",
            "   He drew a deep breath.\n",
            "   “A woman of that description, lost in a town called Salem in the year 1680?”\n",
            "   He reached over and shut the Witch Door.\n",
            "   They sat waiting by it for the rest of the long, cold night.\n",

            "THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The talk in the village in the year 1853 was, of course, about the madman above, in his sod-and-brick hut, with an untended garden and a wife who had fled, silent about his madness, never to return.\n",
            "   The people of the village had never drunk enough courage to go see what the special madness was or why the wife had vanished, tear-stained, leaving a vacuum into which atmospheres had rushed to thunder-clap.\n",
            "   And yet... \n",
            "   On a sweltering hot day with no cloud to offer shadow comfort and no threat of rain to cool man or beast, the Searcher arrived. Which is to say, Dr. Mortimer Goff, a man of many parts, most of them curious and self-serving, but also traveling the world for some baroque event, or miraculous revelation.\n",
            "   The good doctor came tramping up the hill, stumbling over cobbles that were more stone than paving, having abandoned his coach-and-horses, fearful of crippling them with such a climb.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff it turned out, had come from London, inhaling fogs, bombarded by storms, and now, stunned by too much light and heat, this good if curious physician stopped, exhausted, to lean against a fence, sight further up the hill, and ask:\n",
            "   “Is this the way to the lunatic?”\n",
            "   A farmer who was more scarecrow than human raised his eyebrows and snorted, “That would be Elijah Wetherby.”\n",
            "   “If lunatics have names, yes.”\n",
            "   “We call him crazed or mad, but lunatic will do. It sounds like book learning. Are you one of those?”\n",
            "   “I own books, yes, and chemical retorts and a skeleton that was once a man, and a permanent pass to the London Historical and Scientific Museum—”\n",
            "   “All well and good,” the farmer interrupted, “but of no use for failed crops and a dead wife. Follow your nose. And when you find the fool or whatever you name him, take him with you. Were tired of his shouts and commotions late nights in his iron foundry and anvil menagerie. Rumor says he will soon finish some monster that will run to kill us all.”\n",
            "   “Is that true?” asked Dr. Goff.\n",
            "   “No, it lies easy on my tongue. Good day, Doctor, and God deliver you from the lightning bolts that wait for you above.”\n",
            "   With this the farmer spaded the earth to bury the conversation.\n",
            "   So the curious doctor, threatened, climbed on, under a dark cloud which did not stop the sun.\n",
            "   And at last arrived at a hut that seemed more tomb than home, surrounded by land more graveyard than garden.\n",
            "   Outside the ramshackle sod-and-brick dwelling a shadow stepped forth, as if waiting, and became an old, very old, man.\n",
            "   “Well, there you are at last!” it cried.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff reared back at this. “You sound, sir, as if you expected me!”\n",
            "   “I did,” said the old man, “some years ago! What took you so long?”\n",
            "   “You are not exactly cheek by jowl with London, sir.”\n",
            "   “I am not,” the old man agreed and added, “The name is Wetherby. The Inventor”\n",
            "   “Mr. Wetherby, the Inventor. I am Dr. Goff, the so-called Searcher, for I move in behalf of our good Queen, turning rocks, digging truffles, curious for stuffs that might delight her Majesty or fill her museums, shops, and streets in the greatest city in the world. Have I reached the right place?”\n",
            "   “And just in time, for I am now in my eightieth year and of inconsequential vigor. If you had arrived  year, you might have found me in the churchyard. Do come in!”\n",
            "   At this moment, Dr. Goff heard a gathering of people behind him, all with a most unpleasant muttering, so at Mr. Wetherbys beckoning, he was glad to enter, sit, and watch an almost rare whiskey being poured without invitation. When he had quaffed the glass, Dr. Goff swiveled his gaze about the room.\n",
            "   “Well, where is it?”\n",
            "   “Where is what, sir?”\n",
            "   “The lunatic device, the insane machine that goes nowhere but in going might run down a child, a lamb, a priest, a nun, or an old blind dog, where?”\n",
            "   “So I am that famous, am I?” The old man let a few crumbs of laughter fall from his toothless mouth. “Well, sir. I keep it locked in the goats” shed behind: the outhouse of machines. Finish that to strengthen your sanity when you at last behold the delight and grievance of my long inventive life. So!”\n",
            "   The doctor drank, was replenished and soon out the door, across a small, smooth circle of turf, and to a shed whose door was triple-kept with numerous padlocks and keys. Old Wetherby entered, lit many candles, and beckoned the good doctor in.\n",
            "   He pointed as to a manger. The medical Searcher looked, expecting a mother, crib, and holy babe by the way Wetherby gestured and cried:\n",
            "   “There she be!”\n",
            "   “Is it female, then?”\n",
            "   “Come to think, she is!”\n",
            "   And there in the candlelight was Wetherbys mechanical pride.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff coughed, to hide his chagrin.\n",
            "   “That, sir, is but a metal frame!”\n",
            "   “But what a frame to hold velocities! Ha!”\n",
            "   And the old man, young with fevers, rushed to seize a largish wheel which he transported to fit to the front part of the frame. Then he fetched yet another circular object to fit into the frames rear.\n",
            "   “Well?” he cried.\n",
            "   “I see two wheels, half a cart, and no horse!”\n",
            "   “We will shoot all horses!” exclaimed Wetherby. “My invention, by the tens of thousands, will shy off all horses and banish manures. Do you know, each day in London a thousand tons of horse clods must be cleared, fertilizer wasted, not spread on neighbor fields but dumped as sludge down-Thames. God, how I talk!”\n",
            "   “But, sir, continue. Those look to be spinning wheels, borrowed from nearby farms?”\n",
            "   “They are, but spliced and strengthened with metal to sustain”—Wetherby touched himself—”one hundred twenty pounds. And heres the saddle for that weight.” Whereupon he fitted a saddle mid-frame. “And here the stirrups and ribbon to run the back wheel.” So saying, he affixed a longish leather ribbon to one stirrups rotary and tightened it on a spool at the rear.\n",
            "   “Do you begin to perceive, Doctor?”\n",
            "   “I am stranded in ignorance, sir.\n",
            "   “Well, then, be alert, for I now enthrone myself.”\n",
            "   And the old man, light as a chimpanzee, slung himself in place on a leather seat mid-frame between the silent spinning wheels.\n",
            "   “I still see no horse, sir.”\n",
            "   “I am the horse, Doctor. I am the horse a-gallop!”\n",
            "   And the old man thrust his feet in the stirrups to chum them up, around, and down; up, around, and down; as the rear wheels, provoked, did likewise, up, down, around, with a lovely hum, fastened in place on the platform planks.\n",
            "   “Aha.” The doctors face brightened. “This is a device to manufacture electrical power? Something from Benjamin Franklins storm-lightning notebooks?!”\n",
            "   “Gods, no. It could make lightnings, yes! But this, sir, not seeming one, is a horse, and I its night rider! So!”\n",
            "   And Wetherby pumped and wheezed, wheezed and pumped, and the rear wheels, locked in place, spun faster, faster, with a siren whine.\n",
            "   “All very well,” snorted the good doctor, “but the horse, if it is, and the rider, if you are, seem to be going nowhere! What will you call your machine?”\n",
            "   “I have had many nights and years to think.” Wetherby pumped and wheezed. “The Velocitor, perhaps.” Pumpwheeze. “Or the Precipitor, but no, that sounds as if I might be thrown from my “horse. “The Galvanizer, yes? Or why not—” Wheeze-pump. “The Landstride or Diminisher, for—” Wheeze-pump. “It does diminish time and distance. Doctor, you know Latin, eh? So, feet to wheel, wheel run by feet name it!”\n",
            "   “The Elijah, your given name, sir, the Elijah.”\n",
            "   “But he saw a wheel way in the middle of the air and it was a wheel in a wheel, is that not so?”\n",
            "   “When last I was in church, yes. And you are grounded, that is plain to see. Why not Velocipede, then? Having to do with speed and the applied toe and ankle?”\n",
            "   “Close-on, Dr. Goff, close-on. Why do you stare so fixedly?”\n",
            "   “It comes to mind that great times call forth great inventions. The inventor is child to his year and day. This is not a great time for such as you and yours. Did this century call you forth as its mightiest of all men of genius?”\n",
            "   Old Wetherby let his machine coast for a moment and smiled.\n",
            "   “No, I and my Tilda here, I call her Tilda, will instead be the gravity that calls forth the century. We will influence the year, the decade, and the millennium!”\n",
            "   “It is hard for me to believe,” said the medical gentleman, “that you will build a road from your sill to the city on which to glide your not-inconsiderable dream.”\n",
            "   “Nay, Doctor, the reverse is true. The city, and the world when they know me1 and this will run a concourse here to deliver me to fame.”\n",
            "   “Your head knocks heaven, Mr. Wetherby,” said the doctor dryly. “But your roots ache for sustenance, water, minerals, air. You stroke and pump wildly, but go nowhere. Once off that rack, will you not fall on your side, destroyed?”\n",
            "   “Nay, nay.” Wetherby, in gusts, pumped again. “For I have discovered some physics, as yet nameless. The faster you propel this bodily device, the less tendency to fall left or right but continue straight, if no obstacles prevent!”\n",
            "   “With only two wheels beneath? Prove it. Release your invention, set it free in flight, let us see you sustain your forward motion without breaking your bum!”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, shut up!” cried Wetherby as his kindling legs thrashed the pedals, racketing round as he leaned into a phantom wind, eyes clenched against an invisible storm, and churned the wheels to a frenzy. “Dont you hear? Listen. That whine, that cry, that whisper. The ghost in the machine, which promises things most new, unseen, unrealized, only a dream now but tomorrow—Great God, dont you see?! If I were on a real path this would be swifter than gazelles, a panic of deer! All pedestrians vanquished. All coach-and-horses in dust! Not twenty miles a day, but thirty, forty miles in a single glorious hour! Stand off, Time. Beware, meadow-beasts! Here glides, in full plummet, Wetherby with nothing to stop him!”\n",
            "   “Aye,” said the Searcher dryly, “you pump up a storm on that stand. But, set free, how would you balance on only two wheels!?”\n",
            "   “Like this!” cried Wetherby, and with a thrust of his hands and an uplift of frame, seized the Traveler, the Motion Machine, the Pathfinder, up free of its stand and in an instant plunged through the room and out the door, with Dr. Goff, in full pursuit, yelling:\n",
            "   “Stop! Youll kill yourself!”\n",
            "   “No, exhilarate my heart, oxygenate my blood!” cried Wetherby, and there he was in a chicken-yard he had trampled flat, paths some sixty feet around on which he now flailed his metal machine with scythings of ankle, toe, heel, and leg, sucking air, gusting out great laughs. “See? I do not fall! Two legs, two wheels, and: presto!”\n",
            "   “My God!” cried Dr. Goff, eyes thrust forth like hardboiled eggs. “Gods truth! How so?!”\n",
            "   “I fly forward faster than I fall downward, an unguessed law of physics. But lo! I almost fly. Fly! Good-bye horses, doomed and dead!”\n",
            "   And with “dead” he was overcome with such a delirium of pant and pump, perspiration raining off him in showers, that with a great cry, he wobbled and was flung, a meteor of flesh, over and down on a coop where the chickens, in dumb feather-duster alarms, exploded in shrieks as Wetherby slid in one direction while his vehicle, self-motivated, wheels a-spin, mounted Dr. Goff, who jumped aside, fearful of being spliced.\n",
            "   Wetherby, helped to his feet, protested his trajectory:\n",
            "   “Ignore that! Do you at last understand?”\n",
            "   “Fractures, wounds, broken skulls, yes!”\n",
            "   “No, a future brave with motion, “tween my legs. You have come a long way, Doctor. Will you adopt and further my machine?”\n",
            "   “Well,” said the doctor, already out of the yard, into the house, and to the front door, his face confused, his wits a patch of nettles. “Ah,” he said.\n",
            "   “Say you will, Doctor. Or my device dies, and I with it!”\n",
            "   “But...” said the doctor and opened the outer door, only to draw back, alarmed. “What have I done!” he cried.\n",
            "   Peering over his shoulder, Wetherby expressed further alarm. “Your presence is known, Doctor; the word has spread. A lunatic has come to visit a lunatic.”\n",
            "   And it was true. On the road and in the front garden yard were some twelve or twenty farmers and villagers, some with rocks, some with clubs, and with looks of malice or outright hostility caught in their eyes and mouths.\n",
            "   “There they are!” someone cried.\n",
            "   “Have you come to take him away?” someone else shouted.\n",
            "   “Yah” echoed the struggling crowd, moving forward.\n",
            "   Thinking quickly, Dr. Goff replied, “Yes. I will take him away!” And turned back to the old man.\n",
            "   “Take me where, Doctor?” whispered Wetherby, clutching his elbow.\n",
            "   “One moment!” cried the doctor to the crowd, which then subsided in murmurs. “Let me think.”\n",
            "   Standing back, cudgeling his bald spot, and then massaging his brow for rampant inspiration, Dr. Goff at last exhaled in triumph.\n",
            "   “I have it, by George. A genius of an idea, which will please both villagers, to be rid of you, and you, to be rid of them.”\n",
            "   “What, what, Doctor?”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   Looking back now, I cant remember a time when Bug wasnt dancing. Bug is short for jitterbug and, of course, those were the days in the late thirties, our final days in high school and our first days out in the vast world looking for work that didnt exist when jitterbugging was all the rage. And I can remember Bug (his real name was Bert Bagley, which shortens to Bug nicely), during a jazz-band blast at our final aud-call for our high school senior class, suddenly leaping up to dance with an invisible partner in the middle of the front aisle of the auditorium. That brought the house down. You never heard such a roar or such applause. The bandleader, stricken with Bugs oblivious joy, gave an encore and Bug did the same and we all exploded. After that the band played “Thanks for the Memory” and we all sang it, with tears pouring down our cheeks. Nobody in all the years after could forget: Bug dancing in the aisle, eyes shut, hands out to grasp his invisible girlfriend, his legs not connected to his body, just his heart, all over the place. When it was over, nobody, not even the band, wanted to leave. We just stood there in the world Bug had made, hating to go out into that other world that was waiting for us.\n",
            "   It was about a year later when Bug saw me on the street and stopped his roadster and said come on along to my place for a hot dog and a Coke, and I jumped in and we drove over with the top down and the wind really hitting us and Bug talking and talking at the top of his lungs, about life and the times and what he wanted to show me in his front parlor-front parlor, hell, dining room, kitchen, and bedroom.\n",
            "   What was it he wanted me to see?\n",
            "   Trophies. Big ones, little ones, solid gold and silver and brass trophies with his name on them. Dance trophies. I mean they were everywhere, on the floor by his bed, on the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, but in the parlor, especially, they had settled like a locust plague. There were so many of them on the mantel, and in bookcases instead of books, and on the floor, you had to wade through, kicking some over as you went. They totaled, he said, tilting his head back and counting inside his eyelids, to about three hundred and twenty prizes, which means grabbing onto a trophy almost every night in the past year.\n",
            "   “All this,” I gasped, “just since we left high school?”\n",
            "   “Aint I the cats pajamas?” Bug cried.\n",
            "   “Youre the whole darned department store! Who was your partner, all those nights?”\n",
            "   “Not partner, partners,” Bug corrected. “Three hundred, give or take a dozen, different women on three hundred different nights.”\n",
            "   “Where do you find three hundred women, all talented, all good enough, to win prizes?”\n",
            "   “They werent talented or all good,” said Bug, glancing around at his collection. “They were just ordinary, good, every-night dancers. I won the prizes. I made them good. And when we got Out there dancing, we cleared the floor.\n",
            "   Everyone else stopped, to watch us there out in the middle of nowhere, and we never stopped.”\n",
            "   He paused, blushed, and shook his head. “Sorry about that. Didnt mean to brag.”\n",
            "   But he wasnt bragging. I could see. He was just telling the truth.\n",
            "   “You want to know how this all started?” said Bug, handing over a hot dog and a Coke.\n",
            "   “Dont tell me,” I said. “I know.”\n",
            "   “How could you?” said Bug, looking me over.\n",
            "   “The last aud-call at L. A. High, I think they played “Thanks for the Memory,” but just before that—”\n",
            "   ““Roll Out the Barrel—”\n",
            "   “-the Barrel,” yes, and there you were in front of God and everyone, jumping.”\n",
            "   “I never stopped,” said Bug, eyes shut, back in those\n",
            "   years. “Never,” he said, “stopped.”\n",
            "   “You got your life all made,” I said.\n",
            "   “Unless,” said Bug, “something happens.”\n",
            "   What happened was, of course, the war.\n",
            "   Looking back, I remember that in that last year in school, sap that I was, I made up a list of my one hundred and sixty-five best friends. Can you imagine that? One hundred and sixty-five, count “em, best friends! Its a good thing I never showed that list to anyone. I would have been hooted out of school.\n",
            "   \tAnyway, the war came and went and took with it a couple dozen of those listed friends and the rest just disappeared into holes in the ground or went east or wound up in Malibu or Fort Lauderdale. Bug was on that list, but I didnt figure out I didnt really know him until half a lifetime later. By that time I was down to half a dozen pals or women I might turn to if I needed, and it was then, walking down Hollywood Boulevard one Saturday afternoon, I heard someone call:\n",
            "   “How about a hot dog and a Coke?”\n",
            "   Bug, I thought without turning. And thats who it was, standing on the Walk of Stars with his feet planted on Mary Pickford and Ricardo Cortez just behind and Jimmy Stewart just ahead. Bug had taken off some hair and put on some weight, but it was Bug and I was overjoyed, perhaps too much, and showed it, for he seemed embarrassed at my enthusiasm. I saw then that his suit was not half new enough and his shirt frayed, but his tie was neatly tied and he shook my hand off and we popped into a place where we stood and had that hot dog and that Coke.\n",
            "   “Still going to be the worlds greatest writer?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Working at it,” I said.\n",
            "   “Youll get there,” said Bug and smiled, meaning it. “You were always good.”\n",
            "   “So were you,” I said.\n",
            "   That seemed to pain him slightly, for he stopped chewing for a moment and took a swig of Coke. “Yes, sir,” he said. “I surely was.”\n",
            "   “God,” I said, “I can still remember the day I saw all those trophies for the first time. What a family! Whatever-?”\n",
            "   Before I could finish asking, he gave the answer.\n",
            "   “Put “em in storage, some. Some wound up with my first wife. Goodwill got the rest.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” I said, and truly was.\n",
            "   Bug looked at me steadily. “How come youre sorry?”\n",
            "   “Hell, I dunno,” I said. “Its just, they seemed such a part of you. I havent thought of you often the last few years or so, to be honest, but when I do, there you are knee-deep in all those cups and mugs in your front room, out in the kitchen, hell, in your garage!”\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Bug. “What a memory you got.”\n",
            "   We finished our Cokes and it was almost time to go. I couldnt help myself, even seeing that Bug had fleshed himself out over the years.\n",
            "   “When—” I started to say, and stopped.\n",
            "   “When what?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “When,” I said with difficulty, “when was the last time you danced?”\n",
            "   “Years,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “But how long ago?”\n",
            "   “Ten years. Fifteen. Maybe twenty. Yeah, twenty. I dont dance anymore.”\n",
            "   “I dont believe that. Bug not dance? Nuts.”\n",
            "   “Truth. Gave my fancy night-out shoes to the Goodwill, too. Cant dance in your socks.”\n",
            "   “Can, and barefoot, too!”\n",
            "   Bug had to laugh at that. “Youre really something. Well, its been nice.” He started edging toward the door. “Take care, genius—”\n",
            "   “Not so fast.” I walked him out into the light and he was looking both ways as if there were heavy traffic. “You know one thing I never saw and wanted to see? You bragged about it, said you took three hundred ordinary girls out on the dance floor and turned them into Ginger Rogers inside three minutes. But I only saw you once at that aud-call in “38, so I dont believe you.”\n",
            "   “What?” said Bug. “You saw the trophies!”\n",
            "   “You could have had those made up,” I pursued, looking at his wrinkled suit and frayed shirt cuffs. “Anyone can go in a trophy shop and buy a cup and have his name put on it!”\n",
            "   “You think I did that?” cried Bug.\n",
            "   “I think that, yes!”\n",
            "   Bug glanced out in the street and back at me and back in the street and back to me, trying to decide which way to run or push or shout.\n",
            "   “Whats got into you?” said Bug. “Whyre you talking like that?”\n",
            "   “God, I dont know,” I admitted. “Its just, we might not meet again and Ill never have the chance, or you to prove it. Id like, after all this time, to see what you talked about. Id love to see you dance again, Bug.”\n",
            "   “Naw,” said Bug. “Ive forgotten how.”\n",
            "   “Dont hand me that. You may have forgotten, but the rest of you knows how. Bet you could go down to the Ambassador Hotel this afternoon, they still have tea dances there, and clear the floor, just like you said. After youre out there nobody else dances, they all stop and look at you and her just like thirty years ago.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Bug, backing away but coming back. “No, no.”\n",
            "   “Pick a stranger, any girl, any woman, out of the crowd, lead her out, hold her in your arms and just skim her around as if you were on ice and dream her to Paradise.”\n",
            "   “If you write like that, youll never sell,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Bet you, Bug.”\n",
            "   “I dont bet.”\n",
            "   “All right, then. Bet you you cant. Bet you, By God, that youve lost your stuff!”\n",
            "   “Now, hold on,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “I mean it. Lost your stuff forever, for good. Bet you. Wanna bet?”\n",
            "   Bugs eyes took on a peculiar shine and his face was flushed. “How much?”\n",
            "   “Fifty bucks!”\n",
            "   “I dont have—”\n",
            "   “Thirty bucks, then. Twenty! You can afford to lose that, cant you?”\n",
            "   “Who says Id lose, dammit?”\n",
            "   “I say. Twenty. Is it a deal?”\n",
            "   “Youre throwing your money away.”\n",
            "   “No, Im a sure winner, because you cant dance worth shoats and shinola!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your money?” cried Bug, incensed now.\n",
            "   “Here!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your car!?”\n",
            "   “I dont own a car. Never learned to drive. Wheres yours?”\n",
            "   “Sold it! Jesus, no cars. How do we get to the tea dance!?” We got. We grabbed a cab and I paid and, before Bug could relent, dragged him through the hotel lobby and into the ballroom. It was a nice summer afternoon, so nice that the room was filled with mostly middle-aged men and their wives, a few younger ones with their girlfriends, and some kids out of college who looked out of place, embarrassed by the mostly old-folks music out of another time. We got the last table and when Bug opened his mouth for one last protest, I put a straw in it and helped him nurse a marguerita.\n",
            "   “Why are you doing this?” he protested again.\n",
            "   “Because you were just one of one hundred sixty-five close friends!” I said.\n",
            "   “We were never friends,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Well, today, anyway. Theres “Moonlight Serenade. “Always liked that, never danced myself, clumsy fool. On your feet, Bug!”\n",
            "   He was on his feet, swaying.\n",
            "   “Who do you pick?” I said. “You cut in on a couple? Or theres a few wallflowers over there, a tableful of women. I dare you to pick the least likely and give her lessons, yes?”\n",
            "   That did it. Casting me a glance of the purest scorn, he charged off half into the pretty teatime dresses and immaculate men, searching around until his eyes lit on a table where a woman of indeterminate age sat, hands folded, face thin and sickly pale, half hidden under a wide-brimmed hat, looking as if she were waiting for someone who never came.\n",
            "   That one, I thought.\n",
            "   Bug glanced from her to me. I nodded. And in a moment he was bowing at her table and a conversation ensued. It seemed she didnt dance, didnt know how to dance, didnt want to dance. Ah, yes, he seemed to be saying. Ah, no, she seemed to reply. Bug turned, holding her hand, and gave me a long stare and a wink. Then, without looking at her, he raised her by her hand and arm and out, with a seamless glide, onto the floor.\n",
            "   What can I say, how can I tell? Bug, long ago, had never bragged, but only told the truth. Once he got hold of a girl, she was weightless. By the time he had whisked and whirled and glided her once around the floor, she almost took off, it seemed he had to hold her down, she was pure gossamer, the closest thing to a hummingbird held in the hand so you cannot feel its weight but only sense its heartbeat sounding to your touch, and there she went out and around and back, with Bug guiding and moving, enticing and retreating, and not fifty anymore, no, but eighteen, his body remembering what his mind thought it had long forgotten, for his body was free of the earth now, too. He carried himself, as he carried her, with that careless insouciance of a lover who knows what will happen in the  hour and the night soon following.\n",
            "   And it happened, just like he said. Within a minute, a minute and a half at most, the dance floor cleared. As Bug and his stranger lady whirled by with a glance, every couple on the floor stood still. The bandleader almost forgot to keep time with his baton, and the members of the orchestra, in a similar trance, leaned forward over their instruments to see Bug and his new love whirl and turn without touching the floor.\n",
            "   When the “Serenade” ended, there was a moment of stillness and then an explosion of applause. Bug pretended it was all for the lady, and helped her curtsy and took her to her table, where she sat, eyes shut, not believing what had happened. By that time Bug was on the floor again, with one of the wives he borrowed from the nearest table. This time, no one even went out on the floor. Bug and the borrowed wife filled it around and around, and this time even Bugs eyes were shut.\n",
            "   I got up and put twenty dollars on the table where he might find it. After all, he had won the bet, hadnt he?\n",
            "   Why had I done it? Well, I couldnt very well have left him out in the middle of the high school auditorium aisle dancing alone, could I?\n",
            "   On my way out I looked back. Bug saw me and waved, his eyes as brimmed full as mine. Someone passing whispered, “Hey, come on, lookit this guy!”\n",
            "   God, I thought, hell be dancing all night.\n",
            "   Me, I could only walk.\n",
            "   And I went out and walked until I was fifty again and the sun was going down and the low June fog was coming in early over old Los Angeles.\n",
            "   That night, just before going to sleep, I wished that in the morning when Bug woke up he would find the floor around his bed covered with trophies.\n",
            "   Or at the very least he would turn and find a quiet and understanding trophy with her head on his pillow, near enough to touch.\n",
            "\n",

            "ONCE MORE, LEGATO\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine autumn and listened. The drink in his hand remained unsipped, his friend Black unspoken to, the fine house unnoticed, the very weather itself neglected, for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above them.\n",
            "   “My God,” he mid. “Do you “hear?”\n",
            "   “What, the birds?” asked his friend Black, doing just the opposite, sipping his drink, noticing the weather, admiring the rich house, and neglecting the birds entirely until this moment.\n",
            "   “Great God in heaven, listen to them!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   Black listened. “Rather nice.”\n",
            "   “clean out your ears!”\n",
            "   Black made a halfhearted gesture, symbolizing the cleaning out of ears. “Well?”\n",
            "   “Damn it, dont be funny. I mean really listen! Theyre singing a tune!”\n",
            "   “Birds usually do.”\n",
            "   “No, they dont; birds paste together bits and pieces maybe, five or six notes, eight at the most. Mockingbirds have repertoires that change, but not entire melodies. These birds are different. Now shut up and give over!”\n",
            "   Both men sat, enchanted. Blacks expression melted.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” he said at last. “They do go on.” He leaned forward and listened intently.\n",
            "   “Yes...” murmured Fentriss, eyes shut, nodding to the rhythms that sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads. “... ohmigod... indeed.”\n",
            "   Black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up. Fentriss protested with a fierce whisper:\n",
            "   “Dont spoil it. Sit. Be very still. Wheres my pencil? Ah...”\n",
            "   Half peering around, he found a pencil and notepad, shut his eyes, and began to scribble blindly.\n",
            "   The birds sang.\n",
            "   “Youre not actually writing down their song?” said Black.\n",
            "   “What does it look like? Quiet.”\n",
            "   And with eyes now open, now shut, Fentriss drew scales and jammed in the notes.\n",
            "   “I didnt know you read music,” said Black, astonished.\n",
            "   “I played the violin until my father broke it. Please! There. There. Yes!\n",
            "   “Slower,” he whispered. “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   As if hearing, the birds adjusted their lilt, moving toward piano instead of bravado.\n",
            "   A breeze stirred the leaves, like an invisible conductor, and the singing died.\n",
            "   Fentriss, perspiration beading his forehead, stopped scribbling and fell back.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned.” Black gulped his drink. “What was that all about?”\n",
            "   “Writing a song.” Fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper. “Or a tone poem.”\n",
            "   “Let me see that!”\n",
            "   “Wait.” The tree shook itself gently, but produced no further notes. “I want to be sure theyre done.”\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Black seized the pages and let his eyes drift over the scales. “Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,” he said, aghast. “It works.” He glanced up at the thick green of the tree, where no throat warbled, no wing stirred. “What kind of birds are those?”\n",
            "   “The birds of forever, the small beasts of an Immaculate Musical Conception. Something,” said Fentriss, “has made them with child and its name is song—”\n",
            "   “Hogwash!”\n",
            "   “Is it?! Something in the air, in the seeds they ate at dawn, some whim of climate and weather, God! But now theyre mine, its mine. A fine tune.”\n",
            "   “It is” said Black. “But cant be!”\n",
            "   “Never question the miraculous when it happens. Good grief, maybe those damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible songs for months, years, but no one listened. Today, for the first time, someone did. Me! Now, what to do with the gift?”\n",
            "   “You dont seriously mean-?”\n",
            "   “Ive been out of work for a year. I quit my computers, retired early, Im only forty-nine, and have been threatening to knit macrame” to give friends to spoil their walls, day after day. Which shall it be, friend, macrame” or Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Are you Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Just his bastard son.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense,” cried Black, pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the trees as if he might blast the choir. “That tree, those birds, are a Rorschach test. Your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from pure chaos. Theres no discernible tune, no special rhythm. You had me fooled, but I see and hear it now: youve had a repressed desire since childhood to compose. And youve let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by the ears. Put down that pen!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense right back at you.” Fentriss laughed. “Youre jealous that after twelve layabout years, thunderstruck with boredom, one of us has found an occupation. I shall follow it. Listen and write, write and listen. Sit down, youre obstructing the acoustics!”\n",
            "   “Ill sit,” Black exclaimed, “but—” He clapped his hands over his ears.\n",
            "   “Fair enough,” said Fentriss. “Escape fantastic reality while I change a few notes and finish out this unexpected birth.”\n",
            "   Glancing up at the tree, he whispered:\n",
            "   “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   The tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet.\n",
            "   “Crazy,” muttered Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One, two, three hours later, entering the library quietly and then loudly, Black cried out:\n",
            "   “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   Bent over his desk, his hand moving furiously, Fentriss said:\n",
            "   “Finishing a symphony!”\n",
            "   “The same one you began in the garden?”\n",
            "   “No, the birds began, the birds!”\n",
            "   “The birds, then.” Black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions. “How do you know what to do with that stuff?”\n",
            "   “They did most. Ive added variations!”\n",
            "   “An arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack. Have you composed before?”\n",
            "   “Not”-Fentriss let his fingers roam, loop, and scratch-“until today!”\n",
            "   “You realize, of course, youre plagiarizing those songbirds?”\n",
            "   “Borrowing, Black, borrowing. If a milkmaid, singing at dawn, can have her hum borrowed by Berlioz, well! Or if Dvorak, hearing a Dixie banjo plucker pluck “Goin” Home,” steals the banjo to eke out his New World, why cant I weave a net to catch a tune? There! Finito. Done! Give us a title, Black!”\n",
            "   “I? Who sings off-key?”\n",
            "   “What about “The Emperors Nightingale”?”\n",
            "   “Stravinsky.”\n",
            "   “The Birds”?”\n",
            "   “Hitchcock.”\n",
            "   “Damn. Hows this: “Its Only John Cage in a Gilded Bird”?”\n",
            "   “Brilliant. But no one knows who John Cage was.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, Ive got it!” And he wrote:\n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies Baked in a Pie.”\n",
            "   “Blackbirds, you mean; go back to John Cage.”\n",
            "   “Bosh!” Fentriss stabbed the phone. “Hello, Willie? Could you come over? Yes, a small job. Symphonic arrangement for a friend, or friends. Whats your usual Philharmonic fee? Eh? Good enough. Tonight!”\n",
            "   Fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonder in it.\n",
            "   “What ?” he murmured.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies,” with title shortened, premiered at the Glendale Chamber Symphony a month later with standing ovations, incredible reviews.\n",
            "   Fentriss, outside his skin with joy, prepared to launch himself atop large, small, symphonic, operatic, whatever fell on his ears. He had listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks, but bad noted nothing, waiting to see if the “Magpie” experiment was to be repeated. When the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they werent skipping, he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy ceased.\n",
            "   There followed: “Wings,” “Flight,” “Night Chorus,” “The Fledgling Madrigals,” and “Dawn Patrol,” each greeted by new thunderstorms of acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise.\n",
            "   “By now,” said Fentriss, “I should be unbearable to live with, but the birds caution modesty.”\n",
            "   “Also,” said Black, seated under the tree, waiting for a sprig of benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna, “shut up! If all those sly dimwit composers, who will soon be lurking in the bushes, cop your secret, youre a gone poacher.”\n",
            "   “Poacher! By God, yes!” Fentriss laughed. “Poacher.”\n",
            "   And damn if the first poacher didnt arrive!\n",
            "   Glancing out at tree in the morning, Fentriss witnessed a runty shadow stretching up, handheld tape recorder poised, warbling and whistling softly at the tree. when this failed, the half-seen poacher tried dove-coos and then orioles and roosters, half dancing in a circle.\n",
            "   “Damn it to hell!” Fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry: “Is that Wolfgang Prouty poaching my garden? Out, Wolfgang! Go!”\n",
            "   Dropping his recorder, Prouty vaulted a bush, impaled himself on thorns, and vanished.\n",
            "   Fentriss, cursing, picked up an abandoned notepad.\n",
            "   “Nightsong,” it read. On the tape recorder he found a lovely Satie-like bird-choir.\n",
            "   After that, more poachers arrived mid-night to depart at dawn. Their spawn, Fentriss realized, would soon throttle his creativity and still his voice. He loitered full-time in the garden now, not knowing what seed to give his beauties, and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up worms. Wearily he stood guard through sleepless nights, nodding off only to find Wolfgang Proutys evil minions astride the wall, prompting arias, and one night, by God, perched in the tree itself, humming in hopes of sing-alongs.\n",
            "   A shotgun was the final answer. After its first fiery roar, the garden was empty for a week. That is, until-\tSomeone came very late indeed and committed mayhem.\n",
            "   As quietly as possible, he cut the branches and sawed the limbs.\n",
            "   “Oh, envious composers, dreadful murderers!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   And the birds were gone.\n",
            "   And the career of Amadeus Two with it.\n",
            "   “Black!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Yes, dear friend?” said Black, looking at the bleak sky where once green was.\n",
            "   “Is your car outside?”\n",
            "   “When last I looked.”\n",
            "   “Drive!”\n",
            "   But driving in search didnt do it. It wasnt like calling in lost dogs or telephone-poled cats. They must find and cage an entire Mormon tabernacle team of soprano springtime-in-the-Rockies birdseed lovers to prove one in the hand is worth two in the bush.\n",
            "   But still they hastened from block to block, garden to garden, lurking and listening. Now their spirits soared with an echo of “Hallelujah Chorus” oriole warbling, only to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of despair.\n",
            "   Only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt and greens did one of them finally (Black) light his pipe and emit a theory.\n",
            "   “Did you ever think to wonder,” he mused behind a smoke-cloud, “what season of the year this is?”\n",
            "   “Season of the year?” said Fentriss, exasperated.\n",
            "   “Well, coincidentally, wasnt the night the tree fell and the wee songsters blew town, was not that the first fall night of autumn?”\n",
            "   Fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow.\n",
            "   “You mean?”\n",
            "   “Your friends have flown the coop. Their migration must be above San Miguel Allende just now.”\n",
            "   “If they are migratory birds!”\n",
            "   “Do you doubt it?”\n",
            "   Another pained silence, another blow to the head.\n",
            "   “Shit!”\n",
            "   “Precisely,” said Black.\n",
            "   “Friend,” said Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Sir?”\n",
            "   “Drive home.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was a long year, it was a short year, it was a year of anticipation, it was the burgeoning of despair, it was the revival of inspiration, but at its heart, Fentriss knew, just another Tale of Two Cities, but he did not know what the other city was!\n",
            "   How stupid of me, he thought, not to have guessed or imagined that my songsters were wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime swarmed north in A Cappella choirs of sound.\n",
            "   “The waiting,” he told Black, “is madness. The phone never stops—”\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up and addressed it like a child. “Yes. Yes. Of course. Soon. When? Very soon.” And put the phone down. “You see? That was Philadelphia. They want another Cantata as good as the first. At dawn today it was Boston. Yesterday the Vienna Philharmonic. Soon, I say. When? God knows. Lunacy! Where are those angels that once sang me to my rest?”\n",
            "   He threw down maps and weather charts of Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and the Argentines.\n",
            "   “How far south? Do I scour Buenos Aires or Rio, Mazatlan or Cuernavaca? And then? Wander about with a tin ear, standing under trees waiting for bird-drops like a spotted owl? Will the Argentine critics trot by scoffing to see me leaning on trees, eyes shut, waiting for the quasi-melody, the lost chord? Id let no one know the cause of my journey, my search, otherwise pandemoniums of laughter. But in what city, under what kind of tree would I wander to stand? A tree like mine? Do they seek the same roosts? or will anything do in Ecuador or Peru? God, I could waste months guessing and come back with birdseed in my hair and bird bombs on my lapels. What to do, Black? Speak!”\n",
            "   “Well, for one thing”-Black stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his aromatic concepts—” “you might clear off this stump and plant a new tree.”\n",
            "   They had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration. Fentriss froze with one foot raised. “Say that again?!”\n",
            "   “I said—”\n",
            "   “Good grief, you genius! Let me kiss you!”\n",
            "   “Rather not. Hugs, maybe.”\n",
            "   Fentriss hugged him, wildly. “Friend!”\n",
            "   “Always was.”\n",
            "   “Lets get a shovel and spade.”\n",
            "   “You get. Ill watch.”\n",
            "   Fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax.\n",
            "   “Sure you wont join me?”\n",
            "   Black sucked his pipe, blew smoke. “Later.”\n",
            "   “How much would a full-grown tree cost?”\n",
            "   “Too much.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but if it were here and the birds did return?” Black let out more smoke. “Might be worth it. Opus Number Two: “In the Beginning” by Charles Fentriss, stuff like that.”\n",
            "   “In the Beginning,” or maybe “The Return. “”\n",
            "   “One of those.”\n",
            "   “Or—” Fentriss struck the stump with the pickax. ““Rebirth. ““He struck again. “Ode to Joy. ““Another strike.\n",
            "   “Spring Harvest. ““Another. “Let the Heavens Resound. “Hows that, Black?”\n",
            "   “I prefer the other,” said Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The stump was pulled and the new tree bought.\n",
            "   “Dont show me the bill,” Fentriss told his accountant. “Pay it.”\n",
            "   And the tallest tree they could find, of the same family as the one dead and gone, was planted.\n",
            "   “What if it dies before my choir returns?” said Fentriss. “What if it lives,” said Black, “and your choir goes elsewhere?”\n",
            "   The tree, planted, seemed in no immediate need to die. Neither did it look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far southern places.\n",
            "   Meanwhile, the sky, like the tree, was empty. “Dont they know Im waiting?” said Fentriss. “Not unless,” offered Black, “you majored in cross-continental telepathy.”\n",
            "   “Ive checked with Audubon. They say that while the swallows do come back to Capistrano on a special day, give or take a white lie, other migrating species are often one or two weeks late.”\n",
            "   “If I were you,” said Black, “I would plunge into an intense love affair to distract you while you wait.”\n",
            "   “I am fresh out of love affairs.”\n",
            "   “Well, then,” said Black, “suffer.”\n",
            "   The hours passed slower than the minutes, the days passed slower than the hours, the weeks passed slower than the days. Black called. “No birds?”\n",
            "   “No birds.”\n",
            "   “Pity. I cant stand watching you lose weight.” And Black disconnected.\n",
            "   On a final night, when Fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the wall, fearful of another call from the Boston Symphony, he leaned an ax against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky.\n",
            "   “Last chance,” he said. “If the dawn patrol doesnt show by seven a. m., its quits.”\n",
            "   And he touched ax-blade against the tree-bole, took two shots of vodka so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes, and went to bed.\n",
            "   He awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze outside his window, stirring the leaves, with not a ghost of song.\n",
            "   And awoke at dawn with tear-filled eyes, having dreamed that the birds had returned, but knew, in waking, it was only a dream.\n",
            "   And yet...?\n",
            "   Hark, someone might have said in an old novel. List! as in an old play.\n",
            "   Eyes shut, he fine-tuned his ears .\n",
            "   The tree outside, as he arose, looked fatter, as if it had taken on invisible ballasts in the night. There were stirrings there, not of simple breeze or probing winds, but of something in the very leaves that knitted and purled them in rhythms. He dared not look but lay back down to ache his senses and try to know.\n",
            "   A single chirp hovered in the window.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Go on, he thought.\n",
            "   Another chirp.\n",
            "   Dont breathe, he thought; dont let them know youre listening.\n",
            "   Hush.\n",
            "   A fourth sound, then a fifth note, then a sixth and seventh. My God, he thought, is this a substitute orchestra, a replacement choir come to scare off my loves?\n",
            "   Another five notes.\n",
            "   Perhaps, he prayed, theyre only tuning up!\n",
            "   Another twelve notes, of no special timbre or pace, and as he was about to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunch-It happened. Note after note, line after line, fluid melody following spring freshet melody, the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous proclamations of return and welcome in chorus.\n",
            "   And as they sang, Fentriss sneaked his hand to find a pad and pen to hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir that soared and dipped to soar again, firing the bright air that flowed from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to remember.\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up swiftly to hear Black ask\n",
            "   if the waiting was over. Without speaking, he held the receiver in the window.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Blacks voice.\n",
            "   “No, anointed,” whispered the composer, scribbling Cantata No. 2. Laughing, he called softly to the sky.\n",
            "   “Please. More slowly. Legato, not agitato.”\n",
            "   And the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed.\n",
            "   Agitato ceased.\n",
            "   Legato prevailed.\n",
            "\n",

            "EXCHANGE\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There were too many cards in the file, too many books on the shelves, too many children laughing in the childrens room, too many newspapers to fold and stash on the racks... \n",
            "   All in all, too much. Miss Adams pushed her gray hair back over her lined brow, adjusted her gold-rimmed pince-nez, and rang the small silver bell on the library desk, at the same time switching off and on all the lights. The exodus of adults and children was exhausting. Miss Ingraham, the assistant librarian, had gone home early because her father was sick, so it left the burden of stamping, filing, and checking books squarely on Miss Adams” shoulders.\n",
            "   Finally the last book was stamped, the last child fed through the great brass doors, the doors locked, and with immense weariness, Miss Adams moved back up through a silence of forty years of books and being keeper of the books, stood for a long moment by the main desk.\n",
            "   She laid her glasses down on the green blotter, and pressed the bridge of her small-boned nose between thumb and forefinger and held it, eyes shut. What a racket! Children who finger-painted or cartooned frontispieces or rattled their roller skates. High school students arriving with laughters, departing with mindless songs!\n",
            "   Taking up her rubber stamp, she probed the files, weeding out errors, her fingers whispering between Dante and Darwin.\n",
            "   A moment later she heard the rapping on the front-door glass and saw a mans shadow outside, wanting in. She shook her head. The figure pleaded silently, making gestures.\n",
            "   Sighing, Miss Adams opened the door, saw a young man in uniform, and said, “Its late. Were closed.” She glanced at his insignia and added, “Captain.”\n",
            "   “Hold on!” said the captain. “Remember me?”\n",
            "   And repeated it, as she hesitated.\n",
            "   “Remember?”\n",
            "   She studied his face, trying to bring light out of shadow. “Yes, I think I do,” she said at last. “You once borrowed books here.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Many years ago,” she added. “Now I almost have you placed.”\n",
            "   As he stood waiting she tried to see him in those other years, but his younger face did not come clear, or a name with it, and his hand reached out now to take hers.\n",
            "   “May I come in?”\n",
            "   “Well.” She hesitated. “Yes.”\n",
            "   She led the way up the steps into the immense twilight of books. The young officer looked around and let his breath out slowly, then reached to take a book and hold it to his nose, inhaling, then almost laughing.\n",
            "   “Dont mind me, Miss Adams. You ever smell new books? Binding, pages, print. Like fresh bread when youre hungry.” He glanced around. “Im hungry now, but dont even know what for.”\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence, so she asked him how long he might stay.\n",
            "   “Just a few hours. Im on the train from New York to L. A., so I came up from Chicago to see old places, old friends.” His eyes were troubled and he fretted his cap, turning it in his long, slender fingers.\n",
            "   She said gently, “Is anything wrong? Anything I can help you with?”\n",
            "   He glanced out the window at the dark town, with just a few lights in the windows of the small houses across the way.\n",
            "   “I was surprised,” he said.\n",
            "   “By what?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what I expected. Pretty damn dumb,” he said, looking from her to the windows, “to expect that when I went away, everyone froze in place waiting for me to come home. That when I stepped off the train, all my old pals would unfreeze, run down, meet me at the station. Silly.”\n",
            "   “No,” she said, more easily now. “I think we all imagine that. I visited Paris as a young girl, went back to France when I was forty, and was outraged that no one had waited, buildings had vanished, and all the hotel staff where I had once lived had died, retired, or traveled.”\n",
            "   He nodded at this, but could not seem to go on.\n",
            "   “Did anyone know you were coming?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I wrote a few, but no answers. I figured, hell, theyre busy, but theyll be there. They werent.”\n",
            "   She felt the  words come off her lips and was faintly surprised. “Im still here,” she said.\n",
            "   “You are,” he said with a quick smile. “And I cant tell you how glad I am.”\n",
            "   He was gazing at her now with such intensity that she had to look away. “You know,” she said, “I must confess you look familiar, but I dont quite fit your face with the boy who came here—”\n",
            "   “Twenty years ago! And as for what he looked like, that other one, me, well—”\n",
            "   He brought out a smallish wallet which held a dozen pictures and handed over a photograph of a boy perhaps twelve years old, with an impish smile and wild blond hair, looking as if he might catapult out of the frame.\n",
            "   “Ah, yes.” Miss Adams adjusted her pince-nez and closed her eyes to remember. “That one. Spaulding. William Henry Spaulding?”\n",
            "   He nodded and peered at the picture in her hands anxiously.\n",
            "   “Was I a lot of trouble?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” She nodded and held the picture closer and glanced up at him. “A fiend.” She handed the picture back. “But I loved you.”\n",
            "   “Did you?” he said and smiled more broadly.\n",
            "   “In spite of you, yes.”\n",
            "   He waited a moment and then said, “Do you still love me?”\n",
            "   She looked to left and right as if the dark stacks held the answer.\n",
            "   “Its a little early to know, isnt it?”\n",
            "   “Forgive.”\n",
            "   “No, no, a good question. Time will tell. Lets not stand like your frozen friends who didnt move. Come along. Ive just had some late-night coffee. There may be some left. Give me your cap. Take off that coat. The file index is there. Go look up your old library cards for the hell-heck-of it.”\n",
            "   “Are they still there?” In amaze.\n",
            "   “Librarians save everything. You never know whos coming in on the  train. Go.”\n",
            "   When she came back with the coffee, he stood staring down into the index file like a bird fixing its gaze on a half-empty nest. He handed her one of the old purple-stamped cards.\n",
            "   “Migawd,” he said, “I took out a lot of books.”\n",
            "   “Ten at a time. I said no, but you took them. And,” she added, “read them! Here.” She put his cup on top of the file and waited while he drew out canceled card after card and laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “I cant believe. I must not have lived anywhere else but here. May I take this with me, to sit?” He showed the cards. She nodded. “Can you show me around? I mean, maybe Ive forgotten something.”\n",
            "   She shook her head and took his elbow. “I doubt that. Come on. Over here, of course, is the adult section.”\n",
            "   “I begged you to let me cross over when I was thirteen. “Youre not ready,” you said. But—”\n",
            "   “I let you cross over anyway?”\n",
            "   “You did. And much thanks.”\n",
            "   Another thought came to him as he looked down at her.\n",
            "   “You used to be taller than me,” he said.\n",
            "   She looked up at him, amused.\n",
            "   “Ive noticed that happens quite often in my life, but I can still do this.”\n",
            "   Before he could move, she grabbed his chin in her thumb and forefinger and held tight. His eyes rolled.\n",
            "   He said:\n",
            "   “I remember. When I was really bad youd hold on and put your face down close and scowl. The scowl did it. After ten seconds of your holding my chin very tight, I behaved for days.”\n",
            "   She nodded, released his chin. He rubbed it and as they moved on he ducked his head, not looking at her.\n",
            "   “Forgive, I hope you wont be upset, but when I was a boy I used to look up and see you behind your desk, so near but far away, and, how can I say this, I used to think that you were Mrs. God, and that the library was a whole world, and that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing I wanted to see and read, youd find and give it to me.” He stopped, his face coloring. “You did, too. You had the world ready for me every time I asked. There was always a place I hadnt seen, a country I hadnt visited where you took me. Ive never forgotten.”\n",
            "   She looked around, slowly, at the thousands of books. She felt her heart move quietly. “Did you really call me what you just said?”\n",
            "   “Mrs. God? Oh, yes. Often. Always.”\n",
            "   “Come along,” she said at last.\n",
            "   They walked around the rooms together and then downstairs to the newspaper files, and coming back up, he suddenly leaned against the banister, holding tight.\n",
            "   “Miss Adams,” he said.\n",
            "   “What is it, Captain?”\n",
            "   He exhaled. “Im scared. I dont want to leave. Im afraid.”\n",
            "   Her hand, all by itself, took his arm and she finally said, there in the shadows, “Sometimes-Im afraid, too. What frightens you?”\n",
            "   “I dont want to go away without saying good-bye. If I never return, I want to see all my friends, shake hands, slap them on the back, I dont know, make jokes.” He stopped and waited, then went on. “But I walk around town and nobody knows me. Everyones gone.”\n",
            "   The pendulum on the wall clock slid back and forth, shining, with the merest of sounds.\n",
            "   Hardly knowing where she was going, Miss Adams took his arm and guided him up the last steps, away from the marble vaults below, to a final, brightly decorated room, where he glanced around and shook his head.\n",
            "   “Theres no one here, either.”\n",
            "   “Do you believe that?”\n",
            "   “Well, where are they? Do any of my old pals ever come visit, borrow books, bring them back late?”\n",
            "   “Not often,” she said. “But listen. Do you realize Thomas Wolfe was wrong?”\n",
            "   “Wolfe? The great literary beast? Wrong?”\n",
            "   “The title of one of his books.”\n",
            "   “You Cant Go Home Again?” he guessed.\n",
            "   “Thats it. He was wrong. This is home. Your friends are still here. This was your summer place.”\n",
            "   “Yes. Myths. Legends. Mummies. Aztec kings. Wicked sisters who spat toads. Where I really lived. But I dont see my people.”\n",
            "   “Well.”\n",
            "   And before he could speak, she switched on a green-shaded lamp that shed a private light on a small table.\n",
            "   “Isnt this nice?” she said. “Most libraries today, too much light. There should be shadows, dont you think? Some mystery, yes? So that late nights the beasts can prowl out of the stacks and crouch by this jungle light to turn the pages with their breath. Am I crazy?”\n",
            "   “Not that I noticed.”\n",
            "   “Good. Sit. Now that I know who you are, it all comes back.”\n",
            "   “It couldnt possibly.”\n",
            "   “No? Youll see.”\n",
            "   She vanished into the stacks and came out with ten books that she placed upright, their pages a trifle spread so they could stand and he could read the titles.\n",
            "   “The summer of 1930, when you were, what? ten, you read all of these in one week.”\n",
            "   “Oz? Dorothy? The Wizard? Oh, yes.”\n",
            "   She placed still others nearby. “Alice in Wonderland. Through the Looking-Glass. A month later you reborrowed both. “But,” I said, “youve already read them!” “But,” you said, “not enough so I can speak. I want to be able to tell them out loud.”\n",
            "   “My God,” he said quietly, “did I say that?”\n",
            "   “You did. Heres more you read a dozen times. Greek myths, Roman, Egyptian. Norse myths, Chinese. You were ravenous.”\n",
            "   “King Tut arrived from the tomb when I was three. His picture in the Rotogravure started me. What else have you there?”\n",
            "   “Tarzan of the Apes. You borrowed it...\n",
            "   “Three dozen times! John Carter, Warlord of Mars, four dozen. My God, dear lady, how come you remember all this?”\n",
            "   “You never left. Summertimes you were here when I unlocked the doors. You went home for lunch but sometimes brought sandwiches and sat out by the stone lion at noon. Your father pulled you home by your ear some nights when you stayed late. How could I forget a boy like that?”\n",
            "   “But still—”\n",
            "   “You never played, never ran out in baseball weather, or football, I imagine. Why?”\n",
            "   He glanced toward the front door. “They were waiting for me.”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know. The ones who never borrowed books, never read. They. Them. Those.”\n",
            "   She looked and remembered. “Ah, yes. The bullies. Why did they chase you?”\n",
            "   “Because they knew I loved books and didnt much care for them.”\n",
            "   “Its a wonder you survived. I used to watch you getting, reading hunchbacked, late afternoons. You looked so lonely.”\n",
            "   “No. I had these. Company.”\n",
            "   “Heres more.”\n",
            "   She put down Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and Treasure Island.\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said, “and dear and strange Mr. Poe. How I loved his Red Death.”\n",
            "   “You took it so often I told you to keep it on permanent loan unless someone else asked. Someone did, six months later, and when you brought it in I could see it was a terrible blow. A few days later I let you have Poe for another year. I dont recall, did you ever-?”\n",
            "   “Its out in California. Shall I—”\n",
            "   “No, no. Please. Well, here are your books. Let me bring others.”\n",
            "   She came out not carrying many books but one at a time, as if each one were, indeed, special.\n",
            "   She began to make a circle inside the other Stonehenge circle and as she placed the books, in lonely splendor, he said their names and then the names of the authors who had written them and then the names of those who had sat across from him so many years ago and read the books quietly or sometimes whispered the finest parts aloud, so beautifully that no one said Quiet or Silence or even Shh!\n",
            "   She placed the first book and there was a wild field of broom and a wind blowing a young woman across that field as it began to snow and someone, far away, called “Kathy” and as the snows fell he saw a girl he had walked to school in the sixth grade seated across the table, her eyes fixed to the windblown field and the snow and the lost woman in another time of winter.\n",
            "   A second book was set in place and a black and beauteous horse raced across a summer field of green and on that horse was another girl, who hid behind the book and dared to pass him notes when he was twelve.\n",
            "   And then there was the far ghost with a snow-maiden face whose hair was a long golden harp played by the summer airs; she who was always sailing to Byzantium where Emperors were drowsed by golden birds that sang in clockwork cages at sunset and dawn. She who always skirted the outer rim of school and went to swim in the deep lake ten thousand afternoons ago and never came out, so was never found, but suddenly now she made landfall here in the green-shaded light and opened Yeats to at last sail home from Byzantium.\n",
            "   And on her right: John Huff, whose name came clearer than the rest, who claimed to have climbed every tree in town and fallen from none, who had raced through watermelon patches treading melons, never touching earth, to knock down rainfalls of chestnuts with one blow, who yodeled at your sun-up window and wrote the same Mark Twain book report in four different grades before the teachers caught on, at which he said, vanishing, “Just call me Huck.”\n",
            "   And to his right, the pale son of the town hotel owner who looked as if he had gone sleepless forever, who swore every empty house was haunted and took you there to prove it, with a juicy tongue, compressed nose, and throat gargling that sounded the long October demise, the terrible and unutterable fall of the House of Usher.\n",
            "   And  to him was yet another girl.\n",
            "   And  to her... \n",
            "   And just beyond... \n",
            "   Miss Adams placed a final book and he recalled the fair creature, long ago, when such things were left unsaid, glancing up at him one day when he was an unknowing twelve and she was a wise thirteen to quietly say: “I am Beauty. And you, are you the Beast?”\n",
            "   Now, late in time, he wanted to answer that small and wondrous ghost: “No. He hides in the stacks and when the clock strikes three, will prowl forth to drink.”\n",
            "   And it was finished, all the books were placed, the outer ring of his selves and the inner ring of remembered faces, deathless, with summer and autumn names.\n",
            "   He sat for a long moment and then another long moment and then, one by one, reached for and took all of the books that had been his, and still were, and opened them and read and shut them and took another until he reached the end of the outer circle and then went to touch and turn and find the raft on the river, the field of broom where the storms lived, and the pasture with the black and beauteous horse and its lovely rider. Behind him, he heard the lady librarian quietly back away to leave him with words .\n",
            "   A long while later he sat back, rubbed his yes, and looked around at the fortress, the encirclement, the Roman encampment of books, and nodded, his eyes wet.\n",

            "   “Dont ever go away.”\n",
            "   “I wont if youll come back more often.”\n",
            "   Just then, from below the town, not so very far off, a train whistle blew. She said:\n",
            "   “Is that yours?”\n",
            "   “No, but the one soon after,” he said and got up and moved around the small monuments that stood very tall and one by one, shut the covers, his lips moving to sound the old titles and the old, dear names.\n",
            "   “Do we have to put them back on the shelves?” he said. She looked at him and at the double circle and after a long moment said, “Tomorrow will do. Why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” he said, “during the night, because of the color of those lamps, green, the jungle, maybe those creatures you mentioned will come out and turn the pages with their breath. And maybe—”\n",
            "   “What else?”\n",
            "   “Maybe my friends, whove hid in the stacks all these years, will come out, too. “,\n",
            "   “Theyre already here,” she said quietly.\n",
            "   “Yes.” He nodded. “They are.”\n",
            "   And still he could not move.\n",
            "   She backed off across the room without making any sound, and when she reached her desk she called back, the last call of the night.\n",
            "   “Closing time. Closing time, children.”\n",
            "   And turned the lights quickly off and then on and then halfway between; a library twilight.\n",
            "   He moved from the table with the double circle of books and came to her and said, “I Can go now.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said. “William Henry Spaulding. You can.” They walked together as she turned out the lights, turned out the lights, one by one. She helped him into his coat and\n",
            "   then, hardly thinking to do so, he took her hand and kissed her fingers.\n",
            "   It was so abrupt, she almost laughed, but then she said, “Remember what Edith Whanon said when Henry James did what you just did?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “The flavor starts at the elbow.”\n",
            "   They broke into laughter together and he turned and went down the marble steps toward the stained-glass entry. At the bottom of the stairs he looked up at her and said:\n",
            "   “Tonight, when youre going to sleep, remember what I called you when I was twelve, and say it out loud.”\n",
            "   “I dont remember,” she said.\n",
            "   “Yes, you do.”\n",
            "   Below the town, a train whistle blew again.\n",
            "   He opened the front door, stepped out, and he was gone. Her hand on the last light switch, looking in at the double circle of books on the far table, she thought: What was it he called me?\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” she said a moment later.\n",

            "   The cemetery was in the center of the city. On four sides it was bounded by gliding streetcars on glistening blue tracks and cars with exhaust fumes and sound. But, once inside the wall, the world was lost. For half a mile in four directions the cemetery raised midnight trees and headstones that grew from the earth, like pale mushrooms, moist and cold. A gravel path led back into darkness and within the gate stood a Gothic Victorian house with six gables and a cupola. The front-porch light showed an old man there alone, not smoking, not reading, not moving, silent. If you took a deep breath he smelled of the sea, of urine, of papyrus, of kindling, of ivory, and of teak. His false teeth moved his mouth automatically when it wanted to talk. His tiny yellow seed eyes twitched and his poke-hole nostrils thinned as a stranger crunched up the gravel path and set foot on the porch step.\n",
            "   “Good evening!” said the stranger, a young man, perhaps twenty.\n",
            "   The old man nodded, but his hands lay quietly on his knees “I saw that sign out front,” the stranger went on. “FREE DIRT, it said.”\n",
            "   The old man almost nodded.\n",
            "   The stranger tried a smile. “Crazy, but that sign caught my eye.\n",
            "   There was a glass fan over the front door. A light shone through this glass fan, colored blue, red, yellow, and touched the old mans face. It seemed not to bother him.\n",
            "   “I wondered, free dirt? Never struck me youd have much left over. When you dig a hole and put the coffin in and refill the hole, you havent much dirt left, have you? I should think...”\n",
            "   The old man leaned forward. It was so unexpected that the stranger pulled his foot off the bottom step.\n",
            "   “You want some?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Why, no, no, I was just curious. Signs like that make you curious.”\n",
            "   “Set down,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Thanks.” The young man sat uneasily on the steps. “You know how it is, you walk around and never think how it is to own a graveyard.”\n",
            "   “And?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “I mean, like how much time it takes to dig graves.”\n",
            "   The old man leaned back in his chair. “On a cool day:\n",
            "   two hours. Hot day, four. Very hot day, six. Very cold day, not cold so it freezes, but real cold, a man can dig a grave in one hour so he can head in for hot chocolate, brandy in the chocolate. Then again, you get a good man on a hot day, hes no better than a bad man in the cold. Might take eight hours to open up, but heres easy-digging soil here. All loam, no rocks.”\n",
            "   “Im curious about winter.”\n",
            "   “In blizzards we got a icebox mausoleum to stash the dead, undelivered mail, until spring and a whole month of shovels and spades.”\n",
            "   “Seeding and planting time, eh?” The stranger laughed.\n",
            "   “You might say that.”\n",
            "   “Dont you dig in winter anyhow? For special funerals? Special dead?”\n",
            "   “Some yards got a hose-shovel contraption. Pump hot water through the blade; shape a grave quick, like placer mining, even with the ground an ice-pond. We dont cotton to that. Use picks and shovels.”\n",
            "   The young man hesitated. “Does it bother you?”\n",
            "   “You mean, I get scared ever?”\n",
            "   “Well... yes.”\n",
            "   The old man at last took out and stuffed his pipe with tobacco, tamped it with a callused thumb, lit it, let out a small stream of smoke.\n",
            "   “No,” he said at last.\n",
            "   The young mans shoulders sank. “Disappointed?” said the old man. “I thought maybe once .\n",
            "   “Oh, when youre young, maybe. One time... ”\n",
            "   “Then there was a time!” The young man shifted up a step. The old man glanced at him sharply, then resumed smoking. “One time.” He stared at the marbled hills and the dark trees. “My grandpa owned this yard. I was born here. A gravedigger” 5 son learns to ignore things.”\n",
            "   The old man took a number of deep puffs and said:\n",
            "   “I was just eighteen, folks off on vacation, me left to tend things, alone, mow the lawn, dig holes and such. Alone, four graves to dig in October and a cold came hard off the lake, frost on the graves, tombstones like snow, ground froze solid.\n",
            "   “One night I walked out. No moon. Hard grass underfoot, could see my breath, hands in my pockets, walking, listening.”\n",
            "   The old man exhaled frail ghosts from his thin nostrils. “Then I heard this sound, deep under. I froze. It was a voice, screaming. Someone woke up buried, heard me walk by, cried out. I just stood. They screamed and screamed. Earth banged. On a cold night, grounds like porcelain, rings, you see?\n",
            "   “Well—” The old man shut his eyes to remember. “I stood like the wind off the lake stopped my blood. A joke? I searched around and thought, Imagination! No, it was underfoot, sharp, clear. A womans voice. I knew all the gravestones.” The old mans eyelids trembled. “Could recite them alphabetical, year, month, day. Name any year, and Ill tell. How about 1899? Jake Smith departed. And 1923? Betty Dallman lost. And 1933? P. H. Moran! Name a month. August? August last year, buried Henrietta Wells. August 1918? Grandma Hanlon, whole family! Influenza! Name a day, August fourth? Smith, Burke, Shelby carried off. Williamson? Hes on that hill, pink marble. Douglas? By the creek... ”\n",
            "   “The story,” the young man urged.\n",
            "   “Eh?”\n",
            "   “The story you were telling.”\n",
            "   “Oh, the voice below? Well, I knew all the stones. Standing there, I guessed that voice out of the ground was Henrietta Fremwell, fine girl, twenty-four years, played piano at the Elite Theatre. Tall, graceful, blond. How did I know her voice? I stood where there was only mens graves. Hers was the only womans. I ran to put my ear on her stone. Yes! Her voice, way down, screaming!\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell!” I shouted.\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell,” I yelled again.\n",
            "   “Deep down I heard her, only weeping now. Maybe she heard me, maybe not. She just cried. I ran downhill so fast I tripped and split my head on a stone, got up, screamed myself! Got to the tool shed, all blood, dragged out the tools, and just stood there in the moonlight with one shovel. The ground was ice solid, solid. I fell back against a tree. It would take three minutes to get back to her grave, and eight hours of cold night to dig to her box. The ground was like glass. A coffin is a coffin; only so much space for air. Henrietta Fremwell had been buried two days before the freeze, been asleep all that time, using up air, and it rained just before the cold spell and the earth over her, soaked with rainwater now, froze. Id have to dig maybe eight hours. And the way she cried, there wasnt another hour of air left.”\n",
            "   The old mans pipe had gone out. He rocked in his chair, back and forth, back and forth, silently.\n",
            "   “But,” said the young man, “what did you do?”\n",
            "   “Nothing,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Nothing!?”\n",
            "   “Nothing I could do. That ground was solid. Six men couldnt have dug that grave. No hot water near. And she mightve been screaming hours before I heard, so...\n",
            "   “You did-nothing?”\n",
            "   “Something Put the shovel and pick back in the tool shed, locked it and went back to the house and built a fire and drank some hot chocolate, shivering and shivering. Would you have done different?”\n",
            "   “I—”\n",
            "   “Would you have dug for eight hours in hard ice rock sos to reach her when she was truly dead of exhaustion, cold, smothered, and have to bury her all over again? Then call her folks and tell them?”\n",
            "   The young man was silent. On the porch, the mosquitoes hummed about the naked light bulb.\n",
            "   “I see,” said the young man.\n",
            "   The old man sucked his pipe. “I think I cried all night because there was nothing I could do.” He opened his eyes and stared about, surprised, as if he had been listening to someone else.\n",
            "   “Thats quite a story,” said the young man.\n",
            "   “No,” said the old man, “Gods truth. Want to hear more? See that big stone with the ugly angel? That was Adam Crispins. Relatives fought, got a writ from a judge, dug him up hoping for poison. Found nothing. Put him back, but by that time the dirt from his grave mixed with other dirts. We shoveled in stuff from all around. Next plot, the angel with broken wings? Mary-Lou Phipps. Dug her up to lug her off to Elgin, Illinois. More relatives. Where shed been, the pit stayed open, oh, three weeks. No funerals. Meanwhile, her dirt got cross-shoveled with others. Six stones over, one stone north, that was Henry Douglas Jones. Became famous sixty years after no one paid attention. Now hes planted under the Civil War monument. His grave lay wide two months, nobody wanted to utilize the hole of a Southerner, all of us leaning North with Grant. So his dirt got scattered. That give you some notion of what that FREE DIRT sign means?”\n",
            "   The young man eyed the cemetery landscape. “Well,” he said, “where is that dirt youre handing out?”\n",
            "   The old man pointed with his pipe and the stranger looked and indeed, by a nearby wall was a sizable hillock some ten feet long by about three feet high, loam and grass tufts of many shades of tan, brown, and burnt umber.\n",
            "   “Go look,” said the old man.\n",
            "   The young man walked slowly over to stand by the mound.\n",
            "   “Kick it,” said the old man. “See if its real.”\n",
            "   The young man kicked and his face paled.\n",
            "   “Did you hear that?” he said.\n",
            "   “What?” said the old man, looking somewhere else.\n",
            "   The stranger listened and shook his head. “Nothing.”\n",
            "   “Well, now,” said the old man, knocking out the ashes from his pipe. “How much free dirt you need?”\n",
            "   “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Yes, you have,” said the old man, “or you wouldnt have driven your lightweight delivery truck up by the cemetery gate. I got cats ears. Heard your motor just when you stopped. How much?”\n",
            "   “Oh,” said the young man uneasily. “My backyards eighty feet by forty. I could use a good inch of topsoil. So... ?”\n",
            "   “Id say,” said the old man, “half of that mound there. Hell, take it all. Nobody wants it.”\n",
            "   “You mean—”\n",
            "   “I mean, that mound has been growing and diminishing, diminishing and growing, mixtures up and down, since Grant took Richmond and Sherman reached the sea. Theres Civil dirt there, coffin splinters, satin casket shreds from when Lafayette met the Honor Guards Edgar Allan Poe. Theres funeral flowers, blossoms from ten hundred obsequies. Condolence-card confetti for Hessian troopers, Parisian gunners who never shipped home. That soil is so laced with bone meal and casket corsages, I should charge you to buy the lot. Grab a spade before I do.”\n",
            "   “Stay right there.” The young man raised one hand.\n",
            "   “Im not going anywhere,” said the old man. “Nor is anyone else nearby.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The half-truck was pulled up by the dirt mound and the young man was reaching in for a spade when the old man said:\n",
            "   “No, I think not.”\n",
            "   The old man went on:\n",
            "   “Graveyard spades best. Familiar metal, familiar soil. Easy digging when like takes to like. So.”\n",
            "   The old mans head indicated a spade half stuck in the dark mound. The young man shrugged and moved.\n",
            "   The cemetery spade came free with a soft whispering. Pellets of ancient mound fell with similar whispers.\n",
            "   He began to dig and shift and fill the back of his half-truck as the old man from the corners of his eyes observed:\n",
            "   “Its more than dirt, as I said. War of 1812, San Juan Hill, Manassas, Gettysburg, October flu epidemic 1918, all strewn from graves filled and evicted to be refilled. Various occupants leavened out to dust, various glories melted to mixtures, rust from metal caskets, coffin handles, shoelaces but no shoes, hairs long and short. Ever see wreaths made of hair saved to weave crowns to fix on mortal pictures? All thats left of a smile or that funny look in the eyes of someone who knows shes not alive anymore, ever. Hair, epaulettes, not whole ones, but one strand of epaulette, all there along with blood thats gone to silt.”\n",
            "   The young man finished, sweating, and started to thrust the spade back in the earth when the old man said:\n",
            "   “Take it. Cemetery dirt, cemetery spade, like takes to like.”\n",
            "   “Ill bring it back tomorrow.” The young man tossed the spade into the mounded truck.\n",
            "   “No. You got the dirt, so keep the spade. Just dont bring the free dirt back.”\n",
            "   “Why would I do that?”\n",
            "   “Just dont,” said the old man, but did not move as the young man climbed in his truck to start the engine.\n",
            "   He sat listening to the dirt mound tremble and whisper in the flatbed.\n",

Back on the horizon, thunder sounded. A few drops of rain fell on the windshield, causing the young man to ram his foot on the gas and swerve into his home street even as the sun truly died, the wind rose, and the trees around his cottage bent and beckoned.\n",
            "   Climbing out, he stared at the sky and then his house and then the empty garden. A few drops of cold rain on his cheeks decided him; he drove the rattling half-truck into the empty garden, unlatched the metal back-flap, opened it just an inch so as to allow a proper flow, and then began motoring back and forth across the garden, letting the dark stuffs whisper down, letting the strange midnight earth sift and murmur, until at last the truck was empty and he stood in the blowing night, watching the wind stir the black soil.\n",
            "   Then he locked the truck in the garage and went to stand on the back porch, thinking, I wont need water. The storm will soak the ground.\n",
            "   He stood for a long while simply staring at the graveyard mulch, waiting for rain, until he thought, what am I waiting for? Jesus! And went in.\n",
            "   At ten oclock a light rain tapped on the windows and sifted over the dark garden. At eleven it rained so steadily that the gutter drains swallowed and rattled.\n",
            "   At midnight the rain grew heavy. He looked to see if it was eroding the new dark earth but saw only the black muck drinking the downpour like a great black sponge, lit by distant flares of lightning.\n",
            "   Then, at one in the morning, the greatest Niagara of all shuddered the house, rinsed the windows to blindness, and shook the lights.\n",
            "   And then, abruptly, the downpour, the immense Niagara ceased, followed by one great downfell blow of lightning which plowed and pinioned the dark earth close by, near, outside, with explosions of light as if ten thousand flashbulbs had been fired off. Then darkness fell in curtains of thunder, cracking, breaking the bones.\n",
            "   In bed, wishing for the merest dog to hold for lack of human company, hugging the sheets, burying his head, then rising full to the silent air, the dark air, the storm gone, the rain shut, and a silence that spread in whispers as the last drench melted into the trembling soil.\n",
            "   He shuddered and then shivered and then hugged himself to stop the shivering of his cold flesh, and he was thirsty but could not make himself move to find the kitchen and drink water, milk, leftover wine, anything. He lay back, dry-mouthed, with unreasonable tears filling his eyes.\n",
            "   Free dirt, he thought. My God, what a damn-fool night. Free dirt!\n",

            "   “When do you leave?” said the boy. “Where will you go to meet which person where? Alexander? Caesar? Napoleon! Hitler?!”\n",
            "   “No, no!”\n",
            "   The boy exploded his list. “Lincoln—”\n",

            "   “Am I?” Stunned, Harrison Cooper found himself nodding. “Yes, by God, and suddenly—”\n",
            "   Suddenly he knew why he had wept at dawn. He grabbed the young lads hand. “Much thanks. Youre a catalyst—”\n",
            "   “Cat-?”\n",
            "   “A Rorschach test-making me draw my own list-now gently, swiftly-out! No offense.”\n",
            "   The door slammed. He ran for his library phone, punched numbers, waited, scanning the thousand books on the shelves.\n",
            "   “Yes, yes, he murmured, his eyes flicking over the gorgeous sun-bright titles. “Some of you. Two, three, maybe four. Hello! Sam? Samuel! Can you get here in five minutes, make it three? Dire emergency. Come!”\n",
            "   He slammed the phone, swiveled to reach out and touch.\n",
            "   “Shakespeare,” he murmured. “Willy-William, will it be-you?”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The laboratory door opened and Sam/Samuel stuck his head in and froze.\n",
            "   For there, seated in the midst of his great Mobius figure eight, leather jacket and boots shined, picnic lunch packed, was Harrison Cooper, arms flexed, elbows out, fingers alert to the computer controls.\n",
            "   “Wheres your Lindbergh cap and goggles?” asked Samuel.\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper dug them out, put them on, smirking. “Raise the Titanic; then sink it!” Samuel strode to the lovely machine to confront its rather outre” occupant. “Well, Cooper, what?” he cried.\n",
            "   “I woke this morning in tears.”\n",
            "   “Sure. I read the phone book aloud last night. That did it!”\n",
            "   “No. You read me these!”\n",
            "   Cooper handed the books over.\n",
            "   “Sure! We gabbed till three, drunk as owls on English Lit!”\n",

            "   “To what?”\n",
            "   “To their loss. To the fact that they died unknown, unrecognized; to the grim fact that some were only truly recognized, republished, raved over from 1920 on!”\n",
            "   “Cut the cackle and move the buns,” said Samuel. “Did you call to sermonize or ask advice?”\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper leaped from his machine and elbowed Samuel into the library.\n",

            "   “I do!”\n",
            "   “List them, then! The New England Melancholic first. Sad, recluse from land, should have drowned at sea, a lost soul of sixty! Now, what other sad geniuses did we maunder over—”\n",
            "   “God!” Samuel cried. “Youre going to tour them? Oh, Harrison, Harry, I love you!”\n",
            "   “Shut up! Remember how you write jokes? Laugh and think backwards! So let us cry and leap up our tear ducts to the source. Weep for Whales to find minnows!”\n",

            "   Harrison Cooper, seated back in the shadow of the great hovering Mobius ribbon, laughed and nodded. “Yes! Harrison Cooper, L. M. D. Literary Meadow Doctor. Curer of fine old lions off their feed, in dire need of tender love, small applause, the wine of words, all in my heart, all on my tongue. Say “Ah!” So long. Good-bye!”\n",
            "   “God bless!”\n",
            "   He slammed a lever, whirled a knob, and the machine, in a spiral of metal, a whisk of butterfly ribbon, very simply-vanished.\n",
            "   A moment later, the Mobius Machine gave a twist of its atoms and-returned.\n",
            "   “Voila!” cried Harrison Cooper, pink-faced and wild-eyed. “Its done!”\n",
            "   “So soon?” exclaimed his friend Samuel “A minute here, but hours there!”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   A gyroscope spun, a celebratory ribbon spiraled endlessly on itself, and the ghost of a massive window curtain haunted the air, exhaled, and then ceased.\n",
            "   As if fallen from a delivery-chute, the books arrived almost before the footfalls and then the half-seen feet and then the fog-wrapped legs and body and at last the head of a man who, as the ribbon spiraled itself back into emptiness, crouched over the volumes as if warming himself at a hearth.\n",
            "   He touched the books and listened to the air in the dim hallway where dinnertime voices drifted up from below and a door stood wide near his elbow, from which the faint scent of illness came and went, arrived and departed, with the stilted breathing of some patient within the room. Plates and silverware sounded from the world of evening and quiet good health downstairs. The hall and the sickroom were for a time deserted. In a moment, someone might ascend with a tray for the half-sleeping man in the intemperate room.\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper rose with stealth, checking the stairwell, and then, carrying a sweet burden of books, moved into the room, where candles lit both sides of a bed on which the dying man lay supine, arms straight at his sides, head weighting the pillow, eyes grimaced shut, mouth set as if daring the ceiling, mortality itself, to sink and extinguish him.\n",
            "   At the first touch of the books, now on one side, now on the other, of his bed, the old mans eyelids fluttered, his dry lips cracked; the air whistled from his nostrils:\n",
            "   “whos there?” he whispered. “what time is it?”\n",
            "   “whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, then I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can,” replied the traveler at the foot of the bed, quietly.\n",
            "   “what, what?” the old man in the bed whispered swiftly. “It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation,” quoted the visitor, who now moved to place a book under each of the dying mans hands where his tremoring fingers could scratch, pull away, then touch, Braille-like, again.\n",
            "   One by one, the stranger held up book after book, to show the covers, then a page, and yet another title page where printed dates of this novel surfed up, adrift, but to stay forever on some far future shore.\n",
            "   The sick mans eyes lingered over the covers, the tides, the dates, and then fixed to his visitors bright face. He exhaled, stunned. “My God, you have the look of a traveler. From where?”\n",
            "   “Do the years show?” Harrison Cooper leaned forward. “Well, then-I bring you an Annunciation.”\n",
            "   “Such things come to pass only with virgins,” whispered the old man. “No virgin lies here buried under his unread books.”\n",
            "   “I come to unbury you. I bring tidings from a far place.” The sick mans eyes moved to the books beneath his trembling hands.\n",
            "   “Mine?” he whispered.\n",
            "   The traveler nodded solemnly, but began to smile when the color in the old mans face grew warmer arid the expression in his eyes and on his mouth was suddenly eager.\n",
            "   “Is there hope. then?”\n",
            "   “There is!”\n",
            "   “I believe you.” The old man took a breath and then wondered, “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because,” said the stranger at the foot of the bed, “I love you.”\n",
            "   “I do not know you, sir!”\n",
            "   “But I know you fore and aft, port to starboard, main topgallants to gunnels, every day in your long life to here!”\n",
            "   “Oh, the sweet sound!” cried the old man. “Every word that you say, every light from your eyes, is foundation-of-the-world true! How can it be?” Tears winked from the old mans lids. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because I am the truth,” said the traveler. “I have come a long way to find and say: you are not lost. Your great Beast has only drowned some little while. In another year, lost ahead, great and glorious, plain and simple men will gather at your grave and shout: he breeches, he rises, he breeches, he rises! and the white shape will surface to the light, the great terror lift into the storm and thunderous St. Elmos fire and you with him, each bound to each, and no way to tell where he stops and you start or where you stop and he goes off around the world lifting a fleet of libraries in his and your wake through nameless seas of sub-sub-librarians and readers mobbing the docks to chart your far journeyings, alert for your lost cries at three of a wild morn.”\n",
            "   “Christs wounds!” said the man in his winding-sheet bedclothes. “To the point, man, the point! Do you speak truth!?”\n",
            "   “I give you my hand on it, and pledge my soul and my hearts blood.” The visitor moved to do just this, and the two mens fists fused as one. “Take these gifts to the grave. Count these pages like a rosary in your last hours. Tell no one where they came from. Scoffers would knock the ritual beads from your fingers. So tell this rosary in the dark before dawn, and the rosary is this: you will live forever. You are immortal.”\n",
            "   “No more of this, no more! Be still.”\n",
            "   “I can not. Hear me. Where you have passed a fire path will burn, miraculous in the Bengal Bay, the Indian Seas, Hopes Cape, and around the Horn, past perditions landfall, as far as living eyes can see.”\n",
            "   He gripped the old mans fist ever more tightly.\n",
            "   “I swear. In the years ahead, a million millions will crowd your grave to sleep you well and warm your bones. Do you hear?”\n",
            "   “Great God, you are a proper priest to sound my Last Rites. And will I enjoy my own funeral? I will.”\n",
            "   His hands, freed, clung to the books at each side, as the ardent visitor raised yet other books and intoned the dates:\n",
            "   “Nineteen twenty-two... 1930... 1935... 1940 . 1955... 1970. Can you read and know what it means?”\n",
            "   He held the last volume close to the old mans face. The fiery eyes moved. The old mouth creaked.\n",
            "   “Nineteen ninety?”\n",
            "   “Yours. One hundred years from tonight.”\n",
            "   “Dear God!”\n",
            "   “I must go, but I would hear. Chapter One. Speak.”\n",
            "   The old mans eyes slid and burned. He licked his lips, traced the words, and at last whispered, beginning to weep:\n",
            "   “Call me Ishmael.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There was snow and more snow and more snow after that. In the dissolving whiteness, the silver ribbon twirled in a massive whisper to let forth in an exhalation of Time the journeying librarian and his book bag. As if slicing white bread rinsed by snow, the ribbon, as the traveler ghosted himself to flesh, sifted him through the hospital wall into a room as white as December. There, abandoned, lay a man as pale as the snow and the wind. Almost young, he slept with his mustaches oiled to his lip by fever. He seemed not to know nor care that a messenger had invaded the air near his bed. His eyes did not stir, nor did his mouth increase the passage of breath. His hands at his sides did not open to receive. He seemed already lost in a bomb and only his unexpected visitors voice caused his eyes to roll behind their shut lids.\n",
            "   “Are you forgotten?” a voice asked.\n",
            "   “Unborn,” the pale man replied.\n",

            "   “Only. Only in. France.”\n",
            "   “Wrote nothing at all?”\n",

            "   “Tombstones.”\n",
            "   “With names, yes, but not tombstones. Not marble but paper. Dates, yes, but the day after tomorrow and tomorrow and ten thousand after that. And your name on each.”\n",
            "   “It will not be.”\n",
            "   “Is. Let me speak the names. Listen. Masque?”\n",

            "   “Requiescat in pace?”\n",

            "   “Requiescat in pace!”\n",
            "   The Time Wind roared, the room emptied. Nurses ran in, summoned by laughter, and tried to seize the books that weighed down his joy.\n",
            "   “Whats he saying?” someone cried.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   In Paris, an hour, a day, a year, a minute later, there was a run of St. Elmos fire along a church steeple, a blue glow in a dark alley, a soft tread at a street corner, a turnabout of wind like an invisible carousel, and then footfalls up a stair to a door which opened on a bedroom where a window looked out upon cafes filled with people and far music, and in a bed by the window, a tall man lying, his pale face immobile, until he heard alien breath in his room.\n",
            "   The shadow of a man stood over him and now leaned down so that the light from the window revealed a face and a mouth as it inhaled and then spoke. The single word that the mouth said was:\n",

            "   \n",
            "   They drove into green Sunday-morning country, away from the hot aluminum city, and watched as the sky was set free and moved over them like a lake they had never known was there, amazingly blue and with white breakers above them as they traveled.\n",
            "   Clarence Travers slowed the car and felt the cool wind move over his face with the smell of cut grass. He reached over to grasp his wifes hand and glanced at his son and daughter in the backseat, not fighting, at least for this moment, as the car moved through one quiet beauty after another in what might be a Sunday so lush and green it would never end.\n",
            "   “Thank God were doing this,” said Cecelia Travers. “Its been a million years since we got away.” He felt her hand hug his and then relax completely. “when I think of all those ladies dropping dead from the heat at the cocktail parry this afternoon, welt”\n",
            "   “Well, indeed,” said Clarence Travers. “Onward!”\n",
            "   He pressed the gas pedal and they moved faster. Their progress out of the city had been mildly hysterical, with cars shrieking and shoving them toward islands of wilderness praying for picnics that might not be found. Seeing that he had put the car in the fast lane, he slowed to gradually move himself and his family through the banshee traffic until they were idling along at an almost reasonable fifty miles an hour. The scents of flowers and trees that blew in the window made his move worthwhile. He laughed at nothing at all and said:\n",
            "   “Sometimes, when I get this far out, I think lets just keep driving, never go back to the damned city.”\n",
            "   “Lets drive a hundred miles,” shouted his son.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” cried his daughter.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” said Clarence Travers. “But one slow mile at a time.” And then said, softly, “Hey!”\n",
            "   And as suddenly as if they had dreamed it up, the lost highway came into view. “Wonderful!” said Mr. Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “What?” asked the children.\n",
            "   “Look!” said Clarence Travers, leaning over his wife, pointing. “Thats the Old road. The one they used a long time ago.”\n",
            "   “That?” said his wife.\n",
            "   “Its awfully small,” said his son.\n",
            "   “Well, there werent many cars then, they didnt need much.”\n",
            "   “It looks like a big snake,” said his daughter.\n",
            "   “Yeah, the old roads used to twist and turn, all right. Remember?”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers nodded. The car had slowed and they gazed over at that narrow concrete strip with the green grass buckling it gently here or there and sprays of wildflowers nestling up close to either side and the morning sunlight coming down through the high elms and maples and oaks that led the way toward the forest.\n",
            "   “I know it like the nose on my face,” said Clarence Travers. “How would you like to ride on it?”\n",
            "   “Oh, Clarence, now\n",
            "   “I mean it.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Daddy, could we?”\n",
            "   “All right, well do it,” he said decisively.\n",
            "   “We cant!” said Cecelia Travers. “Its probably against the law. It cant be safe.”\n",
            "   But before his wife could finish, he turned off the freeway and let all the swift cars rush on while he drove, smiling at each bump, down over a small ditch, toward the old road.\n",
            "   “Clarence, please! well be arrested!”\n",
            "   “For going ten miles an hour on a highway nobody uses anymore? Lets not kick over any beehives, its too nice a day. Ill buy you all soda pops if you behave.”\n",
            "   They reached the old road.\n",
            "   “See how simple? Now which way, kids?”\n",
            "   “That way, that way!”\n",
            "   “Easy as pie!”\n",
            "   And he let the car take them away on the old highway, the great white-gray boa constrictor that lashed now slowly this way in green moss-velvet meadows, looped over gentle hills, and lowered itself majestically into caves of moist-smelling trees, through the odor of cricks and spring mud and crystal water that rustled like sheets of cellophane over small stone falls. They drove slow enough to see the waterspiders” enigmatic etchings on quiet pools behind dams of last Octobers leaves.\n",
            "   “Daddy, what are those?”\n",
            "   “What, the water-skaters? No one has ever caught one. You wait and wait and put your hand out and bang! The spiders gone. Theyre the first things in life you cant grab onto. The list gets bigger as you grow old, so start small. Dont believe in them. Theyre not really there.”\n",
            "   “Its fun thinking they are.”\n",
            "   “You have just stated a deep philosophical truth. Now, drive on, Mr. Travers.” And obeying his own command with good humor, he drove on.\n",
            "   And they came to a forest that had been like November all through the winter and now, reluctantly, was putting out green flags to welcome the season. Butterflies in great tosses of confetti leaped from the deeps of the forest to ramble drunkenly on the air, their thousand torn shadows following over grass and water.\n",
            "   “Lets go back now,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Aw, Mom,” said the son and daughter.\n",
            "   “Why?” said Clarence Travers. “My God, how many kids back in that damned hot town can say they drove on a road nobody else has used in years? Not one! Not one with a father brave enough to cross a little grass to take the old way. Right?”\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers lapsed into silence.\n",
            "   “Right there,” said Clarence Travers, “over that hill, the highway turns left, then right, then left again, an S curve, and another S. Wait and see.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “An S curve.”\n",
            "   The car purred.\n",
            "   “Another S!”\n",
            "   “Just like you said!”\n",
            "   “Look.” Clarence Travers pointed. A hundred yards across the way from them, the freeway suddenly appeared for a few yards before it vanished, screaming behind stacks of playing-card billboards. Clarence Travers stared fixedly at it and the grass between it and this shadowed path, this silent place like the bottom of an old stream where tides used to come but came no more, where the wind ran through nights making the old sound of far traffic.\n",
            "   “You know something,” said the wife. “That freeway over there scares me.”\n",
            "   “Can we drive home on this old road instead, Dad?” said the son.\n",
            "   “I wish we could.”\n",
            "   “Ive always been scared,” said the wife, watching that other traffic roaring by, gone before it arrived.\n",
            "   “Were all afraid,” said Clarence Travers. “But you pay your money and take your chance. Well?”\n",
            "   His wife sighed. “Damn, get back on that dreadful thing.”\n",
            "   “Not quite yet,” said Clarence Travers and drove to reach a small, very small village, all quite unexpected, a settlement no more than a dozen white clapboard houses mossed under giant trees, dreaming in a green tide of water and leaf-shadow, with wind shaking the rocking chairs on weathered porches and dogs sleeping in the cool nap of grass-carpeting at noon, and a small general store with a dirty red gas pump out front.\n",
            "   They drew up there and got out and stood, unreal in the sudden lack of motion, not quite accepting these houses lost in the wilderness.\n",
            "   The door to the general store squealed open and an old man stepped out, blinked at them, and said, “Say, did you folks just come down that old road?”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers avoided his wifes accusing eyes. “Yes, sir.\n",
            "   “No one on that road in twenty years.”\n",
            "   “We were out for a lark,” said Mr. Travers. “And found a peacock,” he added.\n",
            "   “A sparrow,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “The freeway passed us by, a mile over there, if you want it,” said the old man. “When the new road opened, this town just died on the vine. We got nothing here now but people like me. That is: old.”\n",
            "   “Looks like thered be places here to rent.”\n",
            "   “Mister, just walk in, knock out the bats, stomp the spiders, and any place is yours for thirty bucks a month. I own the whole town.”\n",
            "   “Oh, were not really interested,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Didnt think you would be,” said the old man. “Too far out from the city, too far off the freeway. And that dirt road there slops over when it rains, all muck and mud. And, heck, its against the law to use that path. Not that they ever patrol it.” The old man snorted, shaking his head. “And not that Ill turn you in. But it gave me a nice start just now to see you coming down that rut. J had to give a quick look at my calendar, by God, and make sure it wasnt 1929!”\n",
            "   Lord, I remember, thought Clarence Travers. This is Fox Hill. A thousand people lived here. I was a kid, we passed through on summer nights. We used to stop here late late, and me sleeping in the backseat in the moonlight. My grandmother and grandfather in back with me. Its nice to sleep in a car driving late and the road all white, watching the stars turn as you take the curves, listening to the grown-ups” voices underwater, remote, talking, talking, laughing, murmuring, whispering. My father driving, so stolid. Just to be driving in the summer dark, up along the lake to the Dunes, where the poison ivy grew out on the lonely beach and the wind stayed all the time and never went away. And us driving by that lonely graveyard place of sand and moonlight and poison ivy and the waves tumbling in like dusty ash on the shore, the lake pounding like a locomotive on the sand, coming and going. And me crumpled down and smelling Grandmothers wind-cooled coat and the voices comforting and blanketing me with their solidity and their always-will-be-here sounds that would go on forever, myself always young and us always riding on a summer night in our old Kissel with the side flaps down. And stopping here at nine or ten for Pistachio and Tutti-frutti ice cream that tasted, faintly, beautifully, of gasoline. All of us licking and biting the cones and smelling the gasoline and driving on, sleepy and snug, toward home, Green Town, thirty years ago.\n",
            "   He caught himself and said:\n",
            "   “About these houses, would it be much trouble fixing them up?” He squinted at the old man.\n",
            "   “Well, yes and no, most of “em over fifty years old, lots of dust. You could buy one off me for ten thousand, a real bargain now, youll admit. If you were an artist, now, a painter, or something like that.”\n",
            "   “I write copy in an advertising firm.”\n",
            "   “Write stories, too, no doubt? Well, now, you get a writer out here, quiet, no neighbors, youd do lots of writing.”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers stood silently between the old man and her husband. Clarence Travers did not look at her, but looked at the cinders around the porch of the general store. “I imagine I could work here.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Ive often thought,” said Mr. Travers, “its time we got away from the city and took it a little easy.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers said nothing but searched in her purse and took out a minor.\n",
            "   “Would you like some drinks?” asked Clarence Travers with exaggerated concern. “Three Orange Crushes, make it four,” he told the old man. The old man moved inside the store, which smelled of nails and crackers and dust.\n",
            "   When the old man was gone, Mr. Travers turned to his wife, and his eyes were shining. “Weve always wanted to do it! Lets!”\n",
            "   “Do what?” she said.\n",
            "   “Move out here, snap decision, why not? Why? Weve promised ourselves every year: get away from the noise, the confusion, so the kidsd have a place to play. And...\n",
            "   “Good grief” the wife cried.\n",
            "   The old man moved inside the store, coughing. “Ridiculous.” She lowered her voice. “Weve got the apartment paid up, youve got a fine job, the kids have school with friends, I belong to some fine clubs. And weve just spent a bundle redecorating. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen,” he said, as if she were really listening. “None of thats important. Out here, we can breathe. Back in town, hell, you complain... ”\n",
            "   “Just to have something to complain about.”\n",
            "   “Your clubs cant be that important.”\n",
            "   “Its not clubs, its friends!”\n",
            "   “How many would care if we dropped dead tomorrow?” he said. “If I got hit in that traffic, how many thousand cars would run over me before one stopped to see if I was a man or dog left in the road?”\n",
            "   “Your job...” she started to say.\n",
            "   “My God, ten years ago we said, in two more years well have enough money to quit and write my novel! But each year weve said  year! and  year and  year!”\n",
            "   “Weve had fun, havent we?”\n",
            "   “Sure! Subways are fun, buses are fun, martinis and drunken friends are fun. Advertising? Yeah! But Ive used all the fun there is! I want to write about what Ive seen now, and theres no better place than this. Look at that house over there! Cant you just see me in the front window banging the hell out of my typewriter?”\n",
            "   “Stop hyperventilating!”\n",
            "   “Hyperventilate? God, Id jump for joy to quit. Ive gone as far as I can go. Come on, Cecelia, lets get back some of the spunk in our marriage, take a chance!”\n",
            "   “The children\n",
            "   “Wed love it here!” said the son.\n",
            "   “I think,” said the daughter.\n",
            "   “Im not getting any younger,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “Nor am I,” she said, touching his arm. “But we cant play hopscotch now. When the children leave, yes, well think about it.”\n",
            "   “Children, hopscotch, my God, Ill take my typewriter to the grave!”\n",
            "   “It wont be long. We—”\n",
            "   The shop door squealed open again and whether the old man had been standing in the screen shadow for the last minute, there was no telling. It did not show in his face. He stepped out with four lukewarm bottles of Orange Crush in his rust-spotted hands.\n",
            "   “Here you are,” he said.\n",
            "   Clarence and Cecelia Travers turned to stare at him as if he were a stranger come out to bring them drinks. They smiled and took the bottles.\n",
            "   The four of them stood drinking the soda pop in the warm sunlight. The summer wind blew through the grottoes of trees in the old, shady town. It was like being in a great green church, a cathedral, the trees so high that the people and cottages were lost far down below. All night long you would imagine those trees rustling Their leaves like an ocean on an unending shore. God, thought Clarence Travers, you could really sleep here, the sleep of the dead and the peace-fill-of-heart.\n",
            "   He finished his drink and his wife half finished hers and gave it to the children to argue over, inch by compared inch. The old man stood silent, embarrassed by the thing he may have stirred up among them.\n",
            "   “Well, if youre ever out this way, drop in,” he said. Clarence Travers reached for his wallet.\n",
            "   “No, no!” said the old man. “Its on the house.”\n",
            "   “Thank you, thank you very much.”\n",
            "   “A pleasure.”\n",
            "   They climbed back into their car.\n",
            "   “If you want to get to the freeway,” said the old man, peering through the front window into the cooked-upholstery smell of the car, “just take your old dirt road back. Dont rush, or youll break an axle.”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers looked straight ahead at the radiator fixture on the car front and started the motor.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” the children yelled, and waved. The car moved away through the town.\n",
            "   “Did you hear what the old man said?” asked the wife.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Did you hear him say which way to the freeway?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   He drove through the cool, shady town, staring at the porches and the windows with the colored glass fringing them. If you looked from the inside of those windows out, people had different-colored faces for each pane you looked through. They were Chinese if you looked through one, Indian through another, pink, green, violet, burgundy, wine, chartreuse, the candy colors, the lemon-lime cool colors, the water colors of the windows looking out on lawns and trees and this car slowly driving past.\n",
            "   “Yes, I heard him,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   They left the town behind and took the dirt road to the freeway. They waited their chance, saw an interval between floods of cars hurtling by, swerved out into the stream, and, at fifty miles an hour, were soon hurtling toward the city.\n",
            "   “Thats better,” said Cecelia Travers brightly. She did not look over at her husband. “Now I know where we are.”\n",
            "   Billboards flashed by; a mortuary, a pie crust, a cereal, a garage, a hotel. A hotel in the tar pits of the city, where one day is the pitiless glare of the noon sun, thought Mr. Travers, all of the great Erector-set buildings, like prehistoric dinosaurs, will sink down into the bubbling tar-lava and be encased, bone by bone, for future civilizations. And in the stomachs of the electric lizards, inside the iron dinosaurs, the probing scientists of A. D. One Million will find the little ivory bones, the thinly articulated skeletons of advertising executives and clubwomen and children. Mr. Travers felt his eyes flinch, watering. And the scientists will say, so this is what the iron cities fed on, is it? and give the bones a kick. So this is what kept the iron stomachs full, eh? Poor things, they never had a chance. Probably kept by the iron monsters who needed them in order to survive, who needed them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Aphids, in a way, aphids, kept in a great metal cage.\n",
            "   “Look, Daddy, look, look, before its too late!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The children pointed, yelling. Cecelia Travers did not look. Only the children saw it.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The old highway, two hundred yards away, at their left, sprang back into sight for an instant, wandered aimlessly through field, meadow, and stream, gentle and cool and quiet.\n",
            "   Mr. Travers swung his head sharply to see, but in that instant it was gone. Billboards, trees, hills rushed it away. A thousand cars, honking, shrieking, shouldered them, and bore Clarence and Cecelia Travers and their captive children stunned and silent down the concourse, onward ever onward into a city that had not seen them leave and did not look to see them return\n",
            "   “Lets see if this car will do sixty or sixty-five,” said Clarence Travers.\n",

            "TAKE HASTE TO LIVE: AN AFTERWORD\n",
            "   \n",
            "   When I was eight years old, in 1928, an incredible event occurred on the back wall outside the Academy motion picture theater in Waukegan, Illinois. An advertising broadside, some thirty feet long and twenty feet high, dramatized Black-stone the Magician in half a dozen miraculous poses: sawing a lady in half; tied to an Arabian cannon that exploded, taking him with it; dancing a live handkerchief in midair; causing a birdcage with a live canary to vanish between his fingers; causing an elephant to... well, you get the idea. I must have stood there for hours, frozen with awe. I knew then that someday I must become a magician.\n",
            "   Thats what happened, didnt it? Im not a science fiction, fantasy, magic-realism writer of fairy tales and surrealist poems. Quicker Than the Eye may well be the best title I have ever conjured for a new collection. I pretend to do one thing, cause you to blink, and in the instant seize twenty bright silks out of a bottomless hat.\n",
            "   How does he do that? may well be asked. I really cant say. I dont write these stories, they write me. Which causes me to live with a boundless enthusiasm for writing and life that some misinterpret as optimism.\n",
            "   Nonsense. I am merely a practitioner of optimal behavior, which means behave yourself; listen to your Muses, get your work done, and enjoy the sense that you just might live forever.\n",
            "   I dont have to wait for inspiration. It jolts me every morning. Just before dawn, when I would prefer to sleep in, the damned stuff speaks between my ears with my Theater of Morning voices. Yes, yes, I know, that sounds awfully artsy, and no, no, I am not preaching some sort of Psychic Summons. The voices exist because I stashed them there every day for a lifetime by reading, writing, and living. They accumulated and began to speak soon after high school.\n",
            "   In other words, I do not greet each day with a glad cry but am forced out of bed by these whispering nags, drag myself to the typewriter, and am soon awake and alive as the notion/fancy/concept quits my ears, runs down my elbows and out my fingers. Two hours later, a new story is done that, all night, hid asleep behind my medulla oblongata.\n",
            "   That, dont you agree, is not optimism. Its behavior. Optimal.\n",
            "   I dare not oppose these morning voices. If I did, they would ransack my conscience all day. Besides, I am as out of control as a car off a cliff. What began as a numbed frenzy before breakfast, ends with elation at noon lunch.\n",
            "   How did I find these metaphors? Let me count the ways:\n",
            "   You discover your wife is pregnant with your first child soon to be born, so you name the embryonic presence “Sascha” and converse with this increasingly bright fetus that evolves into a story that you love but no one wants. So here it is.\n",
            "   You wonder whatever happened to Dorian Grays portrait. Your second thoughts grow to an outsize horror by nightfall. You upchuck this hairball into your typewriter.\n",
            "   Some of these stories “happened” to me. “Quicker Than the Eye” was part of a magic show I attended where, with dismay, I saw someone much like myself being made a fool of onstage.\n",
            "   “No News, or What Killed the Dog?” was a Victrola record I played all day every day when I was five, until the neighbors offered to break me or the record, choose.\n",
            "   “That Woman on the Lawn” was first a poem that then turned into a story about my mother as a young and needful woman; a topic we care to discuss only with euphemisms.\n",
            "   “Another Fine Mess” resulted from my writing “The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair.” There had to be a sequel, because when I arrived in Ireland forty years ago, the Irish Times announced LAUREL AND HARDY, ONE TIME ONLY, IN PERSON! FOR THE IRISH ORPHANS. OLYMPIA THEATER, DUBLIN. I rushed to the theater and bought the last ticket, front row center!\n",
            "   The curtain rose and there they were, Stan and Ollie, doing all their old, sweet, wondrous routines. I sat with happy tears streaming down my face. Later I went backstage and stood by their dressing room door watching them greet friends. I didnt introduce myself. I just wanted to warm my hands and heart. After twenty minutes of ambience bathing, I slipped away. Thus “Another Fine Mess.”\n",
            "   “Unterderseaboat Doktor” is an example of people not hearing themselves talk. A writer friend at lunch some years back described his psychiatrist, a former submarine captain in Hitlers undersea fleet. “Holy God,” I cried, “give me a pencil!” I scribbled a title and finished the tale that night. My writer friend hated me for weeks.\n",
            "   “Last Rites” wrote itself because I am the greatest lover of other writers, old or new, who ever lived. I have never been jealous of any writer, I only wanted to write and dream like them. That makes for an enormous list, some of them first-class ladies as well as writers first class: Willa Cather, Jessamyn West, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Weelty, and, long before her current fame, Edith Wharton. “Last Rites” shuttles in Time to pay my respects to three of my heroes, Poe, Melville, and a third writer, nameless until the finale. It crazed me to perceive that these giants died thinking they were to be buried unknown and unread. I had to invent a Time Machine to celebrate them on their deathbeds.\n",
            "   Some of the stories are self-evident. “At the End of the Ninth Year” is the sort of quasi-scientific factoid we all discuss a dozen times, but neglect to write.\n",
            "   “The Other Highway” lies beside the main route heading north from Los Angeles. It has all but vanished under grass, bushes, trees, and avalanched soil. Here and there you can still bike it for some few hundred yards before it melts into the earth.\n",
            "   “Once More, Legato” spontaneously combusted one afternoon when I heard a treeful of birds orchestrating Berlioz and then Albeniz.\n",
            "   If you know the history of Paris during the 1870s” Commune and Haussmann, who tore it down and built it back to the wonder it is now, and if you have experienced some Los Angeles earthquakes, you” could guess the genesis of “Zaharoff/Richter Mark V.” During the last High Shake, two years ago, I thought: My God, the damn fools built the city on the San Andreas Fault! My  thought: what if they built it that way on purpose?!\n",
            "   Two hours later, the story was cooling on the windowsill.\n",
            "   Thats not all, but it should do.\n",
            "   My final advice to myself; the boy magician grown old, and you?\n",
            "   When your dawn theater sounds to clear your sinuses:\n",
            "   dont delay. Jump. Those voices may be gone before you hit the shower to align your wits.\n",
            "   Speed is everything. The 90-mph dash to your machine is a sure cure for life rampant and death most real.\n",
            "   Make haste to live.\n",
            "   Oh, God, yes.\n",

With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.\n",
            "   Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame.\n",
            "   He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered.\n",
            "   He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.\n",
            "   He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.\n",
            "   Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.\n",
            "   The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment before his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a persons standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.\n",
            "   But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper. Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there, waiting?\n",
            "   He turned the corner.\n",
            "   The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting.\n",
            "   The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive, that he felt he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenix-disc on his chest, he spoke again.\n",
            "   “Of course,” he said, “youre a new neighbour, arent you?”\n",
            "   “And you must be”—she raised her eyes from his professional symbols—“the fireman.” Her voice trailed off.\n",
            "   “How oddly you say that.”\n",
            "   “Id-Id have known it with my eyes shut,” she said, slowly.\n",
            "   “What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains,” he laughed. “You never wash it off completely.”\n",
            "   “No, you dont,” she said, in awe.\n",
            "   He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once moving herself.\n",
            "   “Kerosene,” he said, because the silence had lengthened, “is nothing but perfume to me.”\n",
            "   “Does it seem like that, really?”\n",
            "   “Of course. Why not?”\n",
            "   She gave herself time to think of it. “I dont know.” She turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes. “Do you mind if I walk back with you? Im Clarisse McClellan.”\n",
            "   “Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?”\n",
            "   They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the year.\n",
            "   There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.\n",
            "   “Well,” she said, “Im seventeen and Im crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isnt this a nice time of night to walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night, walking, and watch the sun rise.”\n",
            "   They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, “You know, Im not afraid of you at all.”\n",
            "   He was surprised. “Why should you be?”\n",
            "   “So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But youre just a man, after all...”\n",
            "   He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon...\n",
            "   And then Clarisse McClellan said:\n",
            "   “Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked at being a fireman?”\n",
            "   “Since I was twenty, ten years ago.”\n",
            "   “Do you ever read any of the books you bum?”\n",
            "   He laughed. “Thats against the law!”\n",
            "   “Oh. Of course.”\n",
            "   “Its fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn ‘em to ashes, then bum the ashes. Thats our official slogan.”\n",
            "   They walked still further and the girl said, “Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?”\n",
            "   “No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it.”\n",
            "   “Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.”\n",
            "   He laughed.\n",
            "   She glanced quickly over. “Why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” He started to laugh again and stopped “Why?”\n",
            "   “You laugh when I havent been funny and you answer right off. You never stop to think what Ive asked you.”\n",
            "   He stopped walking, “You are an odd one,” he said, looking at her. “Havent you any respect?”\n",
            "   “I dont mean to be insulting. Its just, I love to watch people too much, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Well, doesnt this mean anything to you?” He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-coloured sleeve.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she whispered. She increased her pace. “Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?\n",
            "   “Youre changing the subject!”\n",
            "   “I sometimes think drivers dont know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,” she said. “If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! hed say, thats grass! A pink blur? Thats a rose-garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isnt that funny, and sad, too?”\n",
            "   “You think too many things,” said Montag, uneasily.\n",
            "   “I rarely watch the ‘parlour walls’ or go to races or Fun Parks. So Ive lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.”\n",
            "   “I didnt know that!” Montag laughed abruptly.\n",
            "   “Bet I know something else you dont. Theres dew on the grass in the morning.”\n",
            "   He suddenly couldnt remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite irritable.\n",
            "   “And if you look”—she nodded at the sky—“theres a man in the moon.”\n",
            "   He hadnt looked for a long time.\n",
            "   They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were blazing.\n",
            "   “Whats going on?” Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.\n",
            "   “Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Its like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another time-did I tell you?-for being a pedestrian. Oh, were most peculiar.”\n",
            "   “But what do you talk about?”\n",
            "   She laughed at this. “Good night!” She started up her walk. Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. “Are you happy?” she said.\n",
            "   “Am I what?” he cried.\n",
            "   But she was gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently.\n",
            "   “Happy! Of all the nonsense.”\n",
            "   He stopped laughing.\n",
            "   He put his hand into the glove-hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door slid open.\n",
            "   Of course Im happy. What does she think? Im not? he asked the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes quickly away.\n",
            "   What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked...\n",
            "   Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girls face was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but moving also toward a new sun.\n",
            "   “What?” asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience.\n",
            "   He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your own light to you? People were more often-he searched for a simile, found one in his work-torches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other peoples faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?\n",
            "   What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes? Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would.\n",
            "   Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night...\n",
            "   He opened the bedroom door.\n",
            "   It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not empty.\n",
            "   He listened.\n",
            "   The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.\n",
            "   He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\n",
            "   Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.\n",
            "   The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the curtains and open the french windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling of a man who will die in the  hour for lack of air,. he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed.\n",
            "   An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.\n",
            "   He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night. The breath coming out of the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fibre of hair.\n",
            "   He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick...\n",
            "   Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall; but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out of her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.\n",
            "   The object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under the edge of his own bed. The small crystal bottle of sleeping-tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare.\n",
            "   As he stood there the sky over the house screamed. There was a tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand miles of black linen down the seam. Montag was cut in half. He felt his chest chopped down and split apart. The jet-bombs going over, going over, going over, one two, one two, one two, six of them, nine of them, twelve of them, one and one and one and another and another and another, did all the screaming for him. He opened his own mouth and let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth. The house shook. The flare went out in his hand. The moonstones vanished. He felt his hand plunge toward the telephone.\n",
            "   The jets were gone. He felt his lips move, brushing the mouthpiece of the phone. “Emergency hospital.” A terrible whisper.\n",
            "   He felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be thought as he stood shivering in the dark, and let his lips go on moving and moving.\n",
            "   They had this machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil. Did it drink of the darkness? Did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the years? It fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation and blind searching. It had an Eye. The impersonal operator of the machine could, by wearing a special optical helmet, gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out. What did the Eye see? He did not say. He saw but did not see what the Eye saw. The entire operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in ones yard. The woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they had reached. Go on, anyway, shove the bore down, slush up the emptiness, if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the suction snake. The operator stood smoking a cigarette. The other machine was working too.\n",
            "   The other machine was operated by an equally impersonal fellow in non-stainable reddish-brown overalls. This machine pumped all of the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum.\n",
            "   “Got to clean ‘em out both ways,” said the operator, standing over the silent woman. “No use getting the stomach if you dont clean the blood. Leave that stuff in the blood and the blood hits the brain like a mallet, bang, a couple of thousand times and the brain just gives up, just quits.”\n",
            "   “Stop it!” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I was just sayin,” said the operator.\n",
            "   “Are you done?” said Montag.\n",
            "   They shut the machines up tight. “Were done.” His anger did not even touch them. They stood with the cigarette smoke curling around their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint. “Thats fifty bucks.”\n",
            "   “First, why dont you tell me if shell be all right?”\n",
            "   “Sure, shell be O. K. We got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase here, it cant get at her now. As I said, you take out the old and put in the new and youre O. K.”\n",
            "   “Neither of you is an M. D. Why didnt they send an M. D. from Emergency?”\n",
            "   “Hell!” the operators cigarette moved on his lips. “We get these cases nine or ten a night. Got so many, starting a few years ago, we had the special machines built. With the optical lens, of course, that was new; the rest is ancient. You dont need an M. D., case like this; all you need is two handymen, clean up the problem in half an hour. Look”—he started for the door—“we gotta go. Just had another call on the old ear-thimble. Ten blocks from here. Someone else just jumped off the cap of a pillbox. Call if you need us again. Keep her quiet. We got a contra-sedative in her. Shell wake up hungry. So long.”\n",
            "   And the men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths, the men with the eyes of puff-adders, took up their load of machine and tube, their case of liquid melancholy and the slow dark sludge of nameless stuff, and strolled out the door.\n",
            "   Montag sank down into a chair and looked at this woman. Her eyes were closed now, gently, and he put out his hand to feel the warmness of breath on his palm.\n",
            "   “Mildred,” he said, at last.\n",
            "   There are too many of us, he thought. There are billions of us and thats too many. Nobody knows anyone. Strangers come and violate you. Strangers come and cut your heart out. Strangers come and take your blood. Good God, who were those men? I never saw them before in my life!\n",
            "   Half an hour passed.\n",
            "   The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of colour and they looked soft and relaxed. Someone elses blood there. If only someone elses flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaners and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning. If only...\n",
            "   He got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows wide to let the night air in. It was two oclock in the morning. Was it only an hour ago, Clarisse McClellan in the street, and him coming in, and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle? Only an hour, but the world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colourless form.\n",
            "   Laughter blew across the moon-coloured lawn from the house of Clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly. Above all, their laughter was relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in darkness. Montag heard the voices talking, talking, talking, giving, talking, weaving, reweaving their hypnotic web.\n",
            "   Montag moved out through the french windows and crossed the lawn, without even thinking of it. He stood outside the talking house in the shadows, thinking he might even tap on their door and whisper, “Let me come in. I wont say anything. I just want to listen. What is it youre saying?”\n",
            "   But instead he stood there, very cold, his face a mask of ice, listening to a mans voice (the uncle?) moving along at an easy pace:\n",
            "   “Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow, wad, flush. Everyone using everyone elses coattails. How are you supposed to root for the home team when you dont even have a programme or know the names? For that matter, what colour jerseys are they wearing as they trot out on to the field?”\n",
            "   Montag moved back to his own house, left the window wide, checked Mildred, tucked the covers about her carefully, and then lay down with the moonlight on his cheek-bones and on the frowning ridges in his brow, with the moonlight distilled in each eye to form a silver cataract there.\n",
            "   One drop of rain. Clarisse. Another drop. Mildred. A third. The uncle. A fourth. The fire tonight. One, Clarisse. Two, Mildred. Three, uncle. Four, fire, One, Mildred, two, Clarisse. One, two, three, four, five, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, sleeping-tablets, men, disposable tissue, coat-tails, blow, wad, flush, Clarisse, Mildred, uncle, fire, tablets, tissues, blow, wad, flush. One, two, three, one, two, three! Rain. The storm. The uncle laughing. Thunder falling downstairs. The whole world pouring down. The fire gushing up in a volcano. All rushing on down around in a spouting roar and rivering stream toward morning.\n",
            "   “I dont know anything any more,” he said, and let a sleep-lozenge dissolve on his tongue.\n",
            "   At nine in the morning, Mildreds bed was empty.\n",
            "   Montag got up quickly, his heart pumping, and ran down the hall and stopped at the kitchen door.\n",
            "   Toast popped out of the silver toaster, was seized by a spidery metal hand that drenched it with melted butter.\n",
            "   Mildred watched the toast delivered to her plate. She had both ears plugged with electronic bees that were humming the hour away. She looked up suddenly, saw him, and nodded.\n",
            "   “You all right?” he asked.\n",
            "   She was an expert at lip-reading from ten years of apprenticeship at Seashell ear-thimbles. She nodded again. She set the toaster clicking away at another piece of bread.\n",
            "   Montag sat down.\n",
            "   His wife said, “I dont know why I should be so hungry.”\n",
            "   “You-?”\n",
            "   “Im HUNGRY.”\n",
            "   “Last night,” he began.\n",
            "   “Didnt sleep well. Feel terrible,” she said. “God, Im hungry. I cant figure it.”\n",
            "   “Last night-” he said again.\n",
            "   She watched his lips casually. “What about last night?”\n",
            "   “Dont you remember?”\n",
            "   “What? Did we have a wild party or something? Feel like Ive a hangover. God, Im hungry. Who was here?”\n",
            "   “A few people,” he said.\n",
            "   “Thats what I thought.” She chewed her toast. “Sore stomach, but Im hungry as all-get-out. Hope I didnt do anything foolish at the party.”\n",
            "   “No,” he said, quietly.\n",
            "   The toaster spidered out a piece of buttered bread for him. He held it in his hand, feeling grateful.\n",
            "   “You dont look so hot yourself,” said his wife.\n",
            "   In the late afternoon it rained and the entire world was dark grey. He stood in the hall of his house, putting on his badge with the orange salamander burning across it. He stood looking up at the air-conditioning vent in the hall for a long time. His wife in the TV parlour paused long enough from reading her script to glance up. “Hey,” she said. “The mans THINKING!”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “I wanted to talk to you.” He paused. “You took all the pills in your bottle last night.”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wouldnt do that,” she said, surprised.\n",
            "   “The bottle was empty.”\n",
            "   “I wouldnt do a thing like that. Why would I do a thing like that?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Maybe you took two pills and forgot and took two more, and forgot again and took two more, and were so dopy you kept right on until you had thirty or forty of them in you.”\n",
            "   “Heck,” she said, “what would I want to go and do a silly thing like that for?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” he said.\n",
            "   She was quite obviously waiting for him to go. “I didnt do that,” she said. “Never in a billion years.”\n",
            "   “All right if you say so,” he said.\n",

They write the script with one part missing. Its a new idea. The home-maker, thats me, is the missing part. When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, ‘What do you think of this whole idea, Helen?’ And he looks at me sitting here centre stage, see? And I say, I say—” She paused and ran her finger under a line in the script. ‘I think thats fine!’ And then they go on with the play until he says, ‘Do you agree to that, Helen!’ and I say, ‘I sure do!’ Isnt that fun, Guy?”\n",

No one has time any more for anyone else. Youre one of the few who put up with me. Thats why I think its so strange youre a fireman, it just doesnt seem right for you, somehow.”\n",
            "   He felt his body divide itself into a hotness and a coldness, a softness and a hardness, a trembling and a not trembling, the two halves grinding one upon the other.\n",
            "   “Youd better run on to your appointment,” he said.\n",
            "   And she ran off and left him standing there in the rain. Only after a long time did he move.\n",

            "   The Mechanical Hound slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live in its gently humming, gently vibrating, softly illuminated kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse. The dim light of one in the morning, the moonlight from the open sky framed through the great window, touched here and there on the brass and the copper and the steel of the faintly trembling beast. Light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently, gently, gently, its eight legs spidered under it on rubber-padded paws.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the brass pole. He went out to look at the city and the clouds had cleared away completely, and he lit a cigarette and came back to bend down and look at the Hound. It was like a great bee come home from some field where the honey is full of poison wildness, of insanity and nightmare, its body crammed with that over-rich nectar and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself.\n",
            "   “Hello,” whispered Montag, fascinated as always with the dead beast, the living beast.\n",
            "   At night when things got dull, which was every night, the men slid down the brass poles, and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory system of the Hound and let loose rats in the firehouse area-way, and sometimes chickens, and sometimes cats that would have to be drowned anyway, and there would be betting to see which the Hound would seize first. The animals were turned loose. Three seconds later the game was done, the rat, cat, or chicken caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentling paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the Hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine. The pawn was then tossed in the incinerator. A new game began.\n",
            "   Montag stayed upstairs most nights when this went on. There had been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them, and lost a weeks salary and faced Mildreds insane anger, which showed itself in veins and blotches. But now at night he lay in his bunk, face turned to the wall, listening to whoops of laughter below and the piano-string scurry of rat feet, the violin squeaking of mice, and the great shadowing, motioned silence of the Hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light, finding, holding its victim, inserting the needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a switch had been turned.\n",
            "   Montag touched the muzzle..\n",
            "   The Hound growled.\n",
            "   Montag jumped back.\n",
            "   The Hound half rose in its kennel and looked at him with green-blue neon light flickering in its suddenly activated eyebulbs. It growled again, a strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle, a frying sound, a scraping of metal, a turning of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion.\n",
            "   “No, no, boy,” said Montag, his heart pounding.\n",
            "   He saw the silver needle extended upon the air an inch, pull back, extend, pull back. The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him.\n",
            "   Montag backed up. The Hound took a step from its kennel.\n",
            "   Montag grabbed the brass pole with one hand. The pole, reacting, slid upward, and took him through the ceiling, quietly. He stepped off in the half-lit deck of the upper level. He was trembling and his face was green-white. Below, the Hound had sunk back down upon its eight incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again, its multi-faceted eyes at peace.\n",
            "   Montag stood, letting the fears pass, by the drop-hole. Behind him, four men at a card table under a green-lidded light in the corner glanced briefly but said nothing. Only the man with the Captains hat and the sign of the Phoenix on his hat, at last, curious, his playing cards in his thin hand, talked across the long room.\n",
            "   “Montag...?”\n",
            "   “It doesnt like me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What, the Hound?” The Captain studied his cards.\n",
            "   “Come off it. It doesnt like or dislike. It just ‘functions.’ Its like a lesson in ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide for it. It follows through. It targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. Its only copper wire, storage batteries, and electricity.”\n",
            "   Montag swallowed. “Its calculators can be set to any combination, so many amino acids, so much sulphur, so much butterfat and alkaline. Right?”\n",
            "   “We all know that.”\n",
            "   “All of those chemical balances and percentages on all of us here in the house are recorded in the master file downstairs. It would be easy for someone to set up a partial combination on the Hounds ‘memory,’ a touch of amino acids, perhaps. That would account for what the animal did just now. Reacted toward me.”\n",
            "   “Hell,” said the Captain.\n",
            "   “Irritated, but not completely angry. Just enough ‘memory’ set up in it by someone so it growled when I touched it.”\n",
            "   “Who would do a thing like that?.” asked the Captain. “You havent any enemies here, Guy.”\n",
            "   “None that I know of.”\n",
            "   “Well have the Hound checked by our technicians tomorrow.\n",
            "   “This isnt the first time its threatened me,” said Montag. “Last month it happened twice.”\n",
            "   “Well fix it up. Dont worry”\n",
            "   But Montag did not move and only stood thinking of the ventilator grille in the hall at home and what lay hidden behind the grille. If someone here in the firehouse knew about the ventilator then mightnt they “tell” the Hound...?\n",
            "   The Captain came over to the drop-hole and gave Montag a questioning glance.\n",
            "   “I was just figuring,” said Montag, “what does the Hound think about down there nights? Is it coming alive on us, really? It makes me cold.”\n",
            "   “It doesnt think anything we dont want it to think.”\n",
            "   “Thats sad,” said Montag, quietly, “because all we put into it is hunting and finding and killing. What a shame if thats all it can ever know.”\n",
            "   Beatty snorted, gently. “Hell! Its a fine bit of craftsmanship, a good rifle that can fetch its own target and guarantees the bulls-eye every time.”\n",
            "   “Thats why,” said Montag. “I wouldnt want to be its  victim.\n",
            "   “Why? You got a guilty conscience about something?”\n",
            "   Montag glanced up swiftly.\n",
            "   Beatty stood there looking at him steadily with his eyes, while his mouth opened and began to laugh, very softly.\n",
            "   One two three four five six seven days. And as many times he came out of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumb-tacked to his door. Every day Clarisse walked him to the corner. One day it was raining, the  it was clear, the day after that the wind blew strong, and the day after that it was mild and calm, and the day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer and Clarisse with her face all sunburnt by late afternoon.\n",

But I dont think its social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most dont; they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film-teacher. Thats not social to me at all. Its a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and them telling us its wine when its not. They run us so ragged by the end of the day we cant do anything but go to bed or head for a Fun Park to bully people around, break windowpanes in the Window Smasher place or wreck cars in the Car Wrecker place with the big steel ball. Or go out in the cars and race on the streets, trying to see how close you can get to lamp-posts, playing ‘chicken’ and ‘knock hub-caps.’ I guess Im everything they say I am, all right.

My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children didnt kill each other. But that was a long time ago when they had things different. They believed in responsibility, my uncle says.

The lawn was empty, the trees empty, the street empty, and while at first he did not even know he missed her or was even looking for her, the fact was that by the time he reached the subway, there were vague stirrings of un-ease in him. Something was the matter, his routine had been disturbed. A simple routine, true, established in a short few days, and yet...? He almost turned back to make the walk again, to give her time to appear. He was certain if he tried the same route, everything would work out fine. But it was late, and the arrival of his train put a stop to his plan.\n",

Thursday morning, November 4th,... one thirty-six... one thirty-seven a. m...” The tick of the playing-cards on the greasy table-top, all the sounds came to Montag, behind his closed eyes, behind the barrier he had momentarily erected. He could feel the firehouse full of glitter and shine and silence, of brass colours, the colours of coins, of gold, of silver: The unseen men across the table were sighing on their cards, waiting.\n",

These men who looked steadily into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning black pipes. They and their charcoal hair and soot-coloured brows and bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had shaven close; but their heritage showed. Montag started up, his mouth opened. Had he ever seen a fireman that didnt have black hair, black brows, a fiery face, and a blue-steel shaved but unshaved look? These men were all mirror-images of himself! Were all firemen picked then for their looks as well as their proclivities? The colour of cinders and ash about them, and the continual smell of burning from their pipes. Captain Beatty there, rising in thunderheads of tobacco smoke. Beatty opening a fresh tobacco packet, crumpling the cellophane into a sound of fire.\n",

Their names leapt in fire, burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene. “No.” But in his mind, a cool wind started up and blew out of the ventilator grille at home, softly, softly, chilling his face. And, again, he saw himself in a green park talking to an old man, a very old man, and the wind from the park was cold, too.\n",
            "   Montag hesitated, “Was-was it always like this? The firehouse, our work? I mean, well, once upon a time...”\n",
            "   “Once upon a time!” Beatty said. “What kind of talk is THAT?”\n",
            "   Fool, thought Montag to himself, youll give it away. At the last fire, a book of fairy tales, hed glanced at a single line. “I mean,” he said, “in the old days, before homes were completely fireproofed” Suddenly it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him. He opened his mouth and it was Clarisse McClellan saying, “Didnt firemen prevent fires rather than stoke them up and get them going?”\n",
            "   “Thats rich!” Stoneman and Black drew forth their rulebooks, which also contained brief histories of the Firemen of America, and laid them out where Montag, though long familiar with them, might read:\n",
            "   “Established, 1790, to burn English-influenced books in the Colonies. First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin.”\n",
            "   RULE 1. Answer the alarm swiftly.\n",
            "   2. Start the fire swiftly.\n",
            "   3. Burn everything.\n",
            "   4. Report back to firehouse immediately.\n",
            "   5. Stand alert for other alarms.\n",
            "   Everyone watched Montag. He did not move.\n",
            "   The alarm sounded.\n",
            "   The bell in the ceiling kicked itself two hundred times. Suddenly there were four empty chairs. The cards fell in a flurry of snow. The brass pole shivered. The men were gone.\n",
            "   Montag sat in his chair. Below, the orange dragon coughed into life.\n",
            "   Montag slid down the pole like a man in a dream.\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound leapt up in its kennel, its eyes all green flame.\n",
            "   “Montag, you forgot your helmet!”\n",
            "   He seized it off the wall behind him, ran, leapt, and they were off, the night wind hammering about their siren scream and their mighty metal thunder!\n",
            "   It was a flaking three-storey house in the ancient part of the city, a century old if it was a day, but like all houses it had been given a thin fireproof plastic sheath many years ago, and this preservative shell seemed to be the only thing holding it in the sky.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The engine slammed to a stop. Beatty, Stoneman, and Black ran up the sidewalk, suddenly odious and fat in the plump fireproof slickers. Montag followed.\n",
            "   They crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman, though she was not running, she was not trying to escape. She was only standing, weaving from side to side, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head. Her tongue was moving in her mouth, and her eyes seemed to be trying to remember something, and then they remembered and her tongue moved again:\n",
            "   “ ‘Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.’”\n",
            "   “Enough of that!” said Beatty. “Where are they?”\n",
            "   He slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the question. The old womans eyes came to a focus upon Beatty. “You know where they are or you wouldnt be here,” she said.\n",
            "   Stoneman held out the telephone alarm card with the complaint signed in telephone duplicate on the back\n",
            "   “Have reason to suspect attic; 11 No. Elm, City.—E. B.”\n",
            "   “That would be Mrs. Blake, my neighbour;” said the woman, reading the initials.\n",
            "   “All right, men, lets get ‘em!”\n",
            "   Next thing they were up in musty blackness, swinging silver hatchets at doors that were, after all, unlocked, tumbling through like boys all rollick and shout. “Hey!” A fountain of books sprang down upon Montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stair-well. How inconvenient! Always before it had been like snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victims mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You werent hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldnt be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things dont scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene! Whos got a match!\n",
            "   But now, tonight, someone had slipped. This woman was spoiling the ritual. The men were making too much noise, laughing, joking to cover her terrible accusing silence below. She made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor correct. Montag felt an immense irritation. She shouldnt be here, on top of everything!\n",
            "   Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face A book alighted, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim, wavering light, a page hung. open and it was like a snowy feather, the words delicately painted thereon. In all the rush and fervour, Montag had only an instant to read a line, but it blazed in his mind for the  minute as if stamped there with fiery steel. “Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.” He dropped the book. Immediately, another fell into his arms.\n",
            "   “Montag, up here!”\n",
            "   Montags hand closed like a mouth, crushed the book with wild devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air. They fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below, like a small girl, among the bodies.\n",
            "   Montag had done nothing. His hand had done it all, his hand, with a brain of its own, with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling finger, had turned thief.. Now, it plunged the book back under his arm, pressed it tight to sweating armpit, rushed out empty, with a magicians flourish! Look here! Innocent! Look!\n",
            "   He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were far-sighted. He held it close, as if he were blind.\n",
            "   “Montag!”\n",
            "   He jerked about.\n",
            "   “Dont stand there, idiot!”\n",
            "   The books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone.\n",
            "   “Kerosene! They pumped the cold fluid from the numbered 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book, they pumped rooms full of it.\n",
            "   They hurried downstairs, Montag staggered after them in the kerosene fumes.\n",
            "   “Come on, woman!”\n",
            "   The woman knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag.\n",
            "   “You cant ever have my books,” she said.\n",
            "   “You know the law,” said Beatty. “Wheres your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. Youve been locked up here for years with a regular damned Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now!”\n",
            "   She shook her head.\n",
            "   “The whole house is going up;” said Beatty,\n",
            "   The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at Montag, who stood near the woman.\n",
            "   “Youre not leaving her here?” he protested.\n",
            "   “She wont come.”\n",
            "   “Force her, then!”\n",
            "   Beatty raised his hand in which was concealed the igniter. “Were due back at the house. Besides, these fanatics always try suicide; the patterns familiar.”\n",
            "   Montag placed his hand on the womans elbow. “You can come with me.”\n",
            "   “No,” she said. “Thank you, anyway.”\n",
            "   “Im counting to ten,” said Beatty. “One. Two.”\n",
            "   “Please,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said the woman.\n",
            "   “Three. Four.”\n",
            "   “Here.” Montag pulled at the woman.\n",
            "   The woman replied quietly, “I want to stay here”\n",
            "   “Five. Six.”\n",
            "   “You can stop counting,” she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.\n",
            "   An ordinary kitchen match.\n",
            "   The sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house. Captain Beatty, keeping his dignity, backed slowly through the front door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitements. God, thought Montag, how true! Always at night the alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because the fire is prettier by night? More spectacle, a better show? The pink face of Beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door. The womans hand twitched on the single matchstick. The fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. Montag felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said the woman, and Montag felt himself back away and away out of the door, after Beatty, down the steps, across the lawn, where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail.\n",
            "   On the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly with her eyes, her quietness a condemnation, the woman stood motionless.\n",
            "   Beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene.\n",
            "   He was too late. Montag gasped.\n",
            "   The woman on the porch reached out with contempt for them all, and struck the kitchen match against the railing.\n",
            "   People ran out of houses all down the street.\n",
            "   They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse. Nobody looked at anyone else. Montag sat in the front seat with Beatty and Black. They did not even smoke their pipes. They sat there looking out of the front of the great salamander as they turned a corner and went silently on.\n",
            "   “Master Ridley,” said Montag at last.\n",
            "   “What?” said Beatty.\n",
            "   “She said, ‘Master Ridley.’ She said some crazy thing when we came in the door. ‘Play the man,’ she said, ‘Master Ridley.’ Something, something, something.”\n",
            "   “We shall this day light such a candle, by Gods grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out,” said Beatty. Stoneman glanced over at the Captain, as did Montag, startled.\n",
            "   Beatty rubbed his chin. “A man named Latimer said that to a man named Nicholas Ridley, as they were being burnt alive at Oxford, for heresy, on October 16, 1555.”\n",
            "   Montag and Stoneman went back to looking at the street as it moved under the engine wheels.\n",
            "   “Im full of bits and pieces,” said Beatty. “Most fire captains have to be. Sometimes I surprise myself. WATCH it, Stoneman!”\n",
            "   Stoneman braked the truck.\n",
            "   “Damn!” said Beatty. “Youve gone right by the comer where we turn for the firehouse.”\n",
            "   “Who is it?”\n",
            "   “Who would it be?” said Montag, leaning back against the closed door in the dark.\n",
            "   His wife said, at last, “Well, put on the light.”\n",
            "   “I dont want the light.”\n",
            "   “Come to bed.”\n",
            "   He heard her roll impatiently; the bedsprings squealed.\n",
            "   “Are you drunk?” she said.\n",
            "   So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders, and then the jump-over from shoulder-blade to shoulder-blade like a spark leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger, as if they must look at something, anything, everything.\n",
            "   His wife said, “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   He balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers.\n",
            "   A minute later she said, “Well, just dont stand there in the middle of the floor.”\n",
            "   He made a small sound.\n",
            "   “What?” she asked.\n",
            "   He made more soft sounds. He stumbled towards the bed and shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow. He fell into bed and his wife cried out, startled. He lay far across the room from her, on a winter island separated by an empty sea. She talked to him for what seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about that and it was only words, like the words he had heard once in a nursery at a friends house, a two-year-old child building word patterns, talking jargon, making pretty sounds in the air. But Montag said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small sounds, he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek. He knew that when she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet.\n",
            "   Late in the night he looked over at Mildred. She was awake. There was a tiny dance of melody in the air, her Seashell was tamped in her ear again and she was listening to far people in far places, her eyes wide and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling.\n",
            "   Wasnt there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and telephoned her to ask what was for dinner? Well, then, why didnt he buy himself an audio-Seashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife late at night, murmur, whisper, shout, scream, yell? But what would he whisper, what would he yell? What could he say?\n",
            "   And suddenly she was so strange he couldnt believe he knew her at all. He was in someone elses house, like those other jokes people told of the gentleman, drunk, coming home late at night, unlocking the wrong door, entering a wrong room, and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work and neither of them the wiser.\n",
            "   “Millie...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “I didnt mean to startle you. What I want to know is...”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet. And where?”\n",
            "   “When did we meet for what?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I mean-originally.”\n",
            "   He knew she must be frowning in the dark.\n",
            "   He clarified it. “The first time we ever met, where was it, and when?”\n",
            "   “Why, it was at—”\n",
            "   She stopped.\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said.\n",
            "   He was cold. “Cant you remember?”\n",
            "   “Its been so long.”\n",
            "   “Only ten years, thats all, only ten!”\n",
            "   “Dont get excited, Im trying to think.” She laughed an odd little laugh that went up and up. “Funny, how funny, not to remember where or when you met your husband or wife.”\n",
            "   He lay massaging his eyes, his brow, and the back of his neck, slowly. He held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure there as if to crush memory into place. It was suddenly more important than any other thing in a life-time that he knew where he had met Mildred.\n",
            "   “It doesnt matter,” She was up in the bathroom now, and he heard the water running, and the swallowing sound she made.\n",
            "   “No, I guess not,” he said.\n",
            "   He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc-oxide-faced men with the cigarettes in their straight-lined mouths and the electronic-eyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water, and he wanted to call out to her, how many have you taken TONIGHT! the capsules! how many will you take later and not know? and so on, every hour! or maybe not tonight, tomorrow night! And me not sleeping, tonight or tomorrow night or any night for a long while; now that this has started. And he thought of her lying on the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her, not bent with concern, but only standing straight, arms folded. And he remembered thinking then that if she died, he was certain he wouldnt cry. For it would be the dying of an unknown, a street face, a newspaper image, and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had begun to cry, not at death but at the thought of not crying at death, a silly empty man near a silly empty woman, while the hungry snake made her still more empty.\n",
            "   How do you get so empty? he wondered. Who takes it out of you? And that awful flower the other day, the dandelion! It had summed up everything, hadnt it? “What a shame! Youre not in love with anyone!” And why not?\n",
            "   Well, wasnt there a wall between him and Mildred, when you came down to it? Literally not just one, wall but, so far, three! And expensive, too! And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls, the gibbering pack of tree-apes that said nothing, nothing, nothing and said it loud, loud, loud. He had taken to calling them relatives from the very first. “Hows Uncle Louis today?” “Who?” “And Aunt Maude?” The most significant memory he had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees (you could feel the memory of their shapes all about) sitting in the centre of the “living-room.” The living-room; what a good job of labelling that was now. No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to Mildred.\n",
            "   “Something must be done!I”\n",
            "   “Yes, something must be done!”\n",
            "   “Well, lets not stand and talk!”\n",
            "   “Lets do it!”\n",
            "   “Im so mad I could SPIT!”\n",
            "   What was it all about? Mildred couldnt say. Who was mad at whom? Mildred didnt quite know. What were they going to do? Well, said Mildred, wait around and see.\n",
            "   He had waited around to see.\n",
            "   A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-never-never-quite-no not quite-touched-bottom...and you fell so fast you didnt touch the sides either...never...quite... touched. anything.\n",
            "   The thunder faded. The music died.\n",
            "   “There,” said Mildred,\n",
            "   And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again:\n",
            "   “Well, everything will be all right now,” said an “aunt.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont be too sure,” said a “cousin.”\n",
            "   “Now, dont get angry!”\n",
            "   “Whos angry?”\n",
            "   “YOU are!”\n",
            "   “Youre mad!”\n",
            "   “Why should I be mad!”\n",
            "   “Because!”\n",
            "   “Thats all very well,” cried Montag, “but what are they mad about? Who are these people? Whos that man and whos that woman? Are they husband and wife, are they divorced, engaged, what? Good God, nothings connected up.”\n",
            "   “They—” said Mildred. “Well, they-they had this fight, you see. They certainly fight a lot. You should listen. I think theyre married. Yes, theyre married. Why?”\n",
            "   And if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the dream complete, then it was the open car and Mildred driving a hundred miles an hour across town, he shouting at her and she shouting back and both trying to hear what was said, but hearing only the scream of the car. “At least keep it down to the minimum!” he yelled: “What?” she cried. “Keep it down to fifty-five, the minimum!” he shouted. “The what?” she shrieked. “Speed!” he shouted. And she pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath from his mouth.\n",
            "   When they stepped out of the car, she had the Seashells stuffed in her ears.\n",
            "   Silence. Onlv the wind blowing softlv.\n",
            "   “Mildred.” He stirred in bed.\n",
            "   He reached over and pulled one of the tiny musical insects out of her ear. “Mildred. Mildred?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” Her voice was faint.\n",
            "   He felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between the slots of the phono-colour walls, speaking, but the speech not piercing the crystal barrier. He could only pantomime, hoping she would turn his way and see him. They could not touch through the glass.\n",
            "   “Mildred, do you know that girl I was telling you about?”\n",
            "   “What girl?” She was almost asleep.\n",
            "   “The girl  door.”\n",
            "   “What girl  door?”\n",
            "   “You know, the high-school girl. Clarisse, her name is.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “I havent seen her for a few days-four days to be exact. Have you seen her?”\n",
            "   “No.”\n",

            "   “We couldnt be talking about the same girl.”\n",
            "   “No. The same girl. McClellan. McClellan, Run over by a car. Four days ago. Im not sure. But I think shes dead. The family moved out anyway. I dont know. But I think shes dead.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sure of it!”\n",

            "   They lay there in the dark room not moving, either of them. “Good night,” she said.\n",
            "   He heard a faint rustle. Her hands moved. The electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow, touched by her hand. Now it was in her ear again, humming.\n",
            "   He listened and his wife was singing under her breath.\n",
            "   Outside the house, a shadow moved, an autumn wind rose up and faded away But there was something else in the silence that he heard. It was like a breath exhaled upon the window. It was like a faint drift of greenish luminescent smoke, the motion of a single huge October leaf blowing across the lawn and away.\n",
            "   The Hound, he thought. Its out there tonight. Its out there now. If I opened the window...\n",
            "   He did not open the window.\n",
            "   He had chills and fever in the morning.\n",
            "   “You cant be sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   He closed his eyes over the hotness. “Yes.”\n",
            "   “But you were all right last night.”\n",
            "   “No, I wasnt all right” He heard the “relatives” shouting in the parlour.\n",
            "   Mildred stood over his bed, curiously. He felt her there, he saw her without opening his eyes, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, her eyes with a kind of cataract unseen but suspect far behind the pupils, the reddened pouting lips, the body as thin as a praying mantis from dieting, and her flesh like white bacon. He could remember her no other way.\n",
            "   “Will you bring me aspirin and water?”\n",
            "   “Youve got to get up,” she said. “Its noon. Youve slept five hours later than usual.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn the parlour off?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Thats my family.”\n",
            "   “Will you turn it off for a sick man?”\n",
            "   “Ill turn it down.”\n",
            "   She went out of the room and did nothing to the parlour and came back. “Is that better?”\n",
            "   “Thanks.”\n",
            "   “Thats my favourite programme,” she said.\n",
            "   “What about the aspirin?”\n",
            "   “Youve never been sick before.” She went away again.\n",
            "   “Well, Im sick now. Im not going to work tonight. Call Beatty for me.”\n",
            "   “You acted funny last night.” She returned, humming.\n",
            "   “Wheres the aspirin?” He glanced at the water-glass she handed him.\n",
            "   “Oh.” She walked to the bathroom again. “Did something happen?”\n",
            "   “A fire, is all.”\n",
            "   “I had a nice evening,” she said, in the bathroom.\n",
            "   “What doing?”\n",
            "   “The parlour.”\n",
            "   “What was on?”\n",
            "   “Programmes.”\n",
            "   “What programmes?”\n",
            "   “Some of the best ever.”\n",
            "   “Who?”.\n",
            "   “Oh, you know, the bunch.”\n",
            "   “Yes, the bunch, the bunch, the bunch.” He pressed at the pain in his eyes and suddenly the odour of kerosene made him vomit.\n",
            "   Mildred came in, humming. She was surprised. “Whyd you do that?”\n",
            "   He looked with dismay at the floor. “We burned an old woman with her books.”\n",
            "   “Its a good thing the rugs washable.” She fetched a mop and worked on it. “I went to Helens last night.”\n",
            "   “Couldnt you get the shows in your own parlour?”\n",
            "   “Sure, but its nice visiting.”\n",
            "   She went out into the parlour. He heard her singing.\n",
            "   “Mildred?” he called.\n",
            "   She returned, singing, snapping her fingers softly.\n",
            "   “Arent you going to ask me about last night?” he said.\n",
            "   “What about it?”\n",
            "   “We burned a thousand books. We burned a woman.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   The parlour was exploding with sound.\n",
            "   “We burned copies of Dante and Swift and Marcus Aurelius.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a European?”\n",
            "   “Something like that.”\n",
            "   “Wasnt he a radical?”\n",
            "   “I never read him.”\n",
            "   “He was a radical.” Mildred fiddled with the telephone. “You dont expect me to call Captain Beatty, do you?”\n",
            "   “You must!”\n",
            "   “Dont shout!”\n",
            "   “I wasnt shouting.” He was up in bed, suddenly, enraged and flushed, shaking. The parlour roared in the hot air. “I cant call him. I cant tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   Because youre afraid, he thought. A child feigning illness, afraid to call because after a moments discussion, the conversation would run so: “Yes, Captain, I feel better already. Ill be in at ten oclock tonight.”\n",
            "   “Youre not sick,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag fell back in bed. He reached under his pillow. The hidden book was still there.\n",
            "   “Mildred, how would it be if, well, maybe, I quit my job awhile?”\n",
            "   “You want to give up everything? After all these years of working, because, one night, some woman and her books—”\n",
            "   “You should have seen her, Millie!”\n",
            "   “Shes nothing to me; she shouldnt have had books. It was her responsibility, she should have thought of that. I hate her. Shes got you going and  thing you know well be out, no house, no job, nothing.”\n",
            "   “You werent there, you didnt see,” he said. “There must be something in books, things we cant imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You dont stay for nothing.”\n",
            "   “She was simple-minded.”\n",
            "   “She was as rational as you and I, more so perhaps, and we burned her.”\n",
            "   “Thats water under the bridge.”\n",
            "   “No, not water; fire. You ever seen a burned house? It smoulders for days. Well, this firell last me the rest of my life. God! Ive been trying to put it out, in my mind, all night. Im crazy with trying.”\n",
            "   “You should have thought of that before becoming a fireman.”\n",
            "   “Thought!” he said. “Was I given a choice? My grandfather and father were firemen. In my sleep, I ran after them.”\n",
            "   The parlour was playing a dance tune.\n",
            "   “This is the day you go on the early shift,” said Mildred. “You should have gone two hours ago. I just noticed.”\n",
            "   “Its not just the woman that died,” said Montag. “Last night I thought about all the kerosene Ive used in the past ten years. And I thought about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And Id never even thought that thought before.” He got out of bed.\n",
            "   “It took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down, looking around at the world and life, and then I came along in two minutes and boom! its all over.”\n",
            "   “Let me alone,” said Mildred. “I didnt do anything.”\n",
            "   “Let you alone! Thats all very well, but how can I leave myself alone? We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?”\n",
            "   And then he shut up, for he remembered last week and the two white stones staring up at the ceiling and the pump-snake with the probing eye and the two soap-faced men with the cigarettes moving in their mouths when they talked. But that was another Mildred, that was a Mildred so deep inside this one, and so bothered, really bothered, that the two women had never met. He turned away.\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Well, now youve done it. Out front of the house. Look whos here.”.\n",
            "   “I dont care.”\n",
            "   “Theres a Phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt with an orange snake stitched on his arm coming up the front walk.”\n",
            "   “Captain Beauty?” he said,\n",
            "   “Captain Beatty.”\n",
            "   Montag did not move, but stood looking into the cold whiteness of the wall immediately before him.\n",
            "   “Go let him in, will you? Tell him Im sick.”\n",
            "   “Tell him yourself!” She ran a few steps this way, a few steps that, and stopped, eyes wide, when the front door speaker called her name, softly, softly, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someones here. Fading.\n",
            "   Montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow, climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half-sitting, and after a while Mildred moved and went out of the room and Captain Beatty strolled in, his hands in his pockets.\n",
            "   “Shut the ‘relatives’ up,” said Beatty, looking around at everything except Montag and his wife.\n",
            "   This time, Mildred ran. The yammering voices stopped yelling in the parlour.\n",
            "   Captain Beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a peaceful look on his ruddy face. He took time to prepare and light his brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud. “Just thought Id come by and see how the sick man is.”\n",
            "   “Howd you guess?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his gums and the tiny candy whiteness of his teeth. “Ive seen it all. You were going to call for a night off.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “take the night off!” He examined his eternal matchbox, the lid of which said GUARANTEED: ONE MILLION LIGHTS IN THIS IGNITER, and began to strike the chemical match abstractedly, blow out, strike, blow out, strike, speak a few words, blow out. He looked at the flame. He blew, he looked at the smoke. “When will you be well?”\n",
            "   “Tomorrow. The  day maybe. First of the week.”\n",
            "   Beatty puffed his pipe. “Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession. They dont feed it to rookies like they used to. Damn shame.” Puff. “Only fire chiefs remember it now.” Puff. “Ill let you in on it.”\n",
            "   Mildred fidgeted.\n",
            "   Beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for what he wanted to say.\n",
            "   “When did it all start, you ask, this job of ours, how did it come about, where, when? Well, Id say it really got started around about a thing called the Civil War. Even though our rule-book claims it was founded earlier. The fact is we didnt get along well until photography came into its own. Then—motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass.”\n",
            "   Montag sat in bed, not moving.\n",
            "   “And because they had mass, they became simpler,” said Beatty. “Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books levelled down to a sort of paste pudding norm, do you follow me?”\n",
            "   “I think so.”\n",
            "   Beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air. “Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending.”\n",
            "   “Snap ending.” Mildred nodded.\n",
            "   “Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a tenor twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: ‘now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.’ Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; theres your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.”\n",
            "   Mildred arose and began to move around the room, picking things up and putting them down. Beatty ignored her and continued\n",
            "   “Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl mans mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary, time-wasting thought!”\n",
            "   Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and jump again as she patted his pillow. Right now she was pulling at his shoulder to try to get him to move so she could take the pillow out and fix it nicely and put it back. And perhaps cry out and stare or simply reach down her hand and say, “Whats this?” and hold up the hidden book with touching innocence.\n",
            "   “School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages dropped, English and spelling gradually neglected, finally almost completely ignored. Life is immediate, the job counts, pleasure lies all about after work. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts?”\n",
            "   “Let me fix your pillow,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “No!” whispered Montag,\n",
            "   “The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at. dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.”\n",
            "   Mildred said, “Here.”\n",
            "   “Get away,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Life becomes one big pratfall, Montag; everything bang; boff, and wow!”\n",
            "   “Wow,” said Mildred, yanking at the pillow.\n",
            "   “For Gods sake, let me be!” cried Montag passionately.\n",
            "   Beatty opened his eyes wide.\n",
            "   Mildreds hand had frozen behind the pillow. Her fingers were tracing the books outline and as the shape became familiar her face looked surprised and then stunned. Her mouth opened to ask a question...\n",
            "   “Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colours running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or sauterne. You like baseball, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Baseballs a fine game.”\n",
            "   Now Beatty was almost invisible, a voice somewhere behind a screen of smoke\n",
            "   “Whats this?” asked Mildred, almost with delight. Montag heaved back against her arms. “Whats this here?”\n",
            "   “Sit down!” Montag shouted. She jumped away, her hands empty. “Were talking!”\n",
            "   Beatty went on as if nothing had happened. “You like bowling, dont you, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Bowling, yes.”\n",
            "   “And golf?”\n",
            "   “Golf is a fine game.”\n",
            "   “Basketball?”\n",
            "   “A fine game.”.\n",
            "   “Billiards, pool? Football?”\n",
            "   “Fine games, all of them.”\n",
            "   “More sports for everyone, group spirit, fun, and you dont have to think, eh? Organize and organize and superorganize super-super sports. More cartoons in books. More pictures. The mind drinks less and less. Impatience. Highways full of crowds going somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, nowhere. The gasoline refugee. Towns turn into motels, people in nomadic surges from place to place, following the moon tides, living tonight in the room where you slept this noon and I the night before.”\n",
            "   Mildred went out of the room and slammed the door. The parlour “aunts” began to laugh at the parlour “uncles.”,\n",
            "   “Now lets take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Dont step on the toes of the dog?lovers, the cat?lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second?generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic?books survive. And the three?dimensional sex?magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didnt come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade?journals.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but what about the firemen, then?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Ah.” Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. “What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word ‘intellectual,’ of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally ‘bright,’ did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasnt it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house  door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach mans mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well?read man? Me? I wont stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. Thats you, Montag, and thats me.”\n",
            "   The door to the parlour opened and Mildred stood there looking in at them, looking at Beatty and then at Montag. Behind her the walls of the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of trap?drums, tom?toms, and cymbals. Her mouth moved and she was saying something but the sound covered it.\n",
            "   Beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand, studied the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for meaning.\n",
            "   “You must understand that our civilization is so vast that we cant have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isnt that right? Havent you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well, arent they? Dont we keep them moving, dont we give them fun? Thats all we live for, isnt it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these.”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Montag could lip?read what Mildred was saying in the doorway. He tried not to look at her mouth, because then Beatty might turn and read what was there, too.\n",
            "   “Coloured people dont like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people dont feel good about Uncle Toms Cabin. Burn it. Someones written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Bum the book. Serenity, Montag. Peace, Montag. Take your fight outside. Better yet, into the incinerator. Funerals are unhappy and pagan? Eliminate them, too. Five minutes after a person is dead hes on his way to the Big Flue, the Incinerators serviced by helicopters all over the country. Ten minutes after death a mans a speck of black dust. Lets not quibble over individuals with memoriams. Forget them. Burn them all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean.”\n",
            "   The fireworks died in the parlour behind Mildred. She had stopped talking at the same time; a miraculous coincidence. Montag held his breath.\n",
            "   “There was a girl  door,” he said, slowly. “Shes gone now, I think, dead. I cant even remember her face. But she was different. How?how did she happen?”\n",
            "   Beatty smiled. “Here or there, thats bound to occur. Clarisse McClellan? Weve a record on her family. Weve watched them carefully. Heredity and environment are funny things. You cant rid yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. Thats why weve lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now were almost snatching them from the cradle. We had some false alarms on the McClellans, when they lived in Chicago. Never found a book. Uncle had a mixed record; anti?social. The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, Im sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didnt want to know how a thing was done, but why. That can be embarrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girls better off dead.”\n",
            "   “Yes, dead.”\n",
            "   “Luckily, queer ones like her dont happen, often. We know how to nip most of them in the bud, early. You cant build a house without nails and wood. If you dont want a house built, hide the nails and wood. If you dont want a man unhappy politically, dont give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the Government is inefficient, top?heavy, and tax?mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of non?combustible data, chock them so damned full of ‘facts’ they feel stuffed, but absolutely ‘brilliant’ with information. Then theyll feel theyre thinking, theyll get a sense of motion without moving. And theyll be happy, because facts of that sort dont change. Dont give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide?rule, measure, and equate the universe, which just wont be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely. I know, Ive tried it; to hell with it. So bring on your clubs and parties, your acrobats and magicians, your dare-devils, jet cars, motor?cycle helicopters, your sex and heroin, more of everything to do with automatic reflex. If the drama is bad, if the film says nothing, if the play is hollow, sting me with the theremin, loudly. Ill think Im responding to the play, when its only a tactile reaction to vibration. But I dont care. I just like solid entertainment.”\n",
            "   Beatty got up. “I must be going. Lectures over. I hope Ive clarified things. The important thing for you to remember, Montag, is were the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dyke. Hold steady. Dont let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world. We depend on you. I dont think you realize how important you are, to our happy world as it stands now.”\n",
            "   Beatty shook Montags limp hand. Montag still sat, as if the house were collapsing about him and he could not move, in the bed. Mildred had vanished from the door.\n",
            "   “One last thing,” said Beatty. “At least once in his career, every fireman gets an itch. What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, Ive had to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. Theyre about non?existent people, figments of imagination, if theyre fiction. And if theyre non?fiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher screaming down anothers gullet. All of them running about, putting out the stars and extinguishing the sun. You come away lost.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, what if a fireman accidentally, really not, intending anything, takes a book home with him?”\n",
            "   Montag twitched. The open door looked at him with its great vacant eye.\n",
            "   “A natural error. Curiosity alone,” said Beatty. “We dont get over?anxious or mad. We let the fireman keep the book twenty?four hours. If he hasnt burned it by then, we simply come and burn it for him.”\n",
            "   “Of course.” Montags mouth was dry.\n",
            "   “Well, Montag. Will you take another, later shift, today? Will we see you tonight perhaps?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What?” Beatty looked faintly surprised.\n",
            "   Montag shut his eyes. “Ill be in later. Maybe.”\n",
            "   “Wed certainly miss you if you didnt show,” said Beatty, putting his pipe in his pocket thoughtfully.\n",
            "   Ill never come in again, thought Montag.\n",
            "   “Get well and keep well,” said Beatty.\n",
            "   He turned and went out through the open door.\n",
            "   Montag watched through the window as Beatty drove away in his gleaming yellow?flame?coloured beetle with the black, char?coloured tyres.\n",
            "   Across the street and down the way the other houses stood with their flat fronts. What was it Clarisse had said one afternoon? “No front porches. My uncle says there used to be front porches. And people sat there sometimes at night, talking when they wanted to talk, rocking, and not talking when they didnt want to talk. Sometimes they just sat there and thought about things, turned things over. My uncle says the architects got rid of the front porches because they didnt look well. But my uncle says that was merely rationalizing it; the real reason, hidden underneath, might be they didnt want people sitting like that, doing nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life. People talked too much. And they had time to think. So they ran off with the porches. And the gardens, too. Not many gardens any more to sit around in. And look at the furniture. No rocking?chairs any more. Theyre too comfortable. Get people up and running around. My uncle says... and... my uncle... and... my uncle...” Her voice faded.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Montag turned and looked at his wife, who sat in the middle of the parlour talking to an announcer, who in turn was talking to her. “Mrs. Montag,” he was saying. This, that and the other. “Mrs. Montag?” Something else and still another. The converter attachment, which had cost them one hundred dollars, automatically supplied her name whenever the announcer addressed his anonymous audience, leaving a blank where the proper syllables could be filled in. A special spot?wavex?scrambler also caused his televised image, in the area immediately about his lips, to mouth the vowels and consonants beautifully. He was a friend, no doubt of it, a good friend. “Mrs. Montag?now look right here.”\n",
            "   Her head turned. Though she quite obviously was not listening.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Its only a step from not going to work today to not working tomorrow, to not working at the firehouse ever again.”,\n",
            "   “You are going to work tonight, though, arent you?” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “I havent decided. Right now Ive got an awful feeling I want to smash things and kill things:\n",
            "   “Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No thanks.”\n",
            "   “The keys to the beetle are on the night table. I always like to drive fast when I feel that way. You get it up around ninetyfive and you feel wonderful. Sometimes I drive all night and come back and you dont know it. Its fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs. Go take the beetle.”\n",
            "   “No, I dont want to, this time. I want to hold on to this funny thing. God, its gotten big on me. I dont know what it is. Im so damned unhappy, Im so mad, and I dont know why I feel like Im putting on weight. I feel fat. I feel like Ive been saving up a lot of things, and dont know what. I might even start reading books.”\n",
            "   “Theyd put you in jail, wouldnt they?” She looked at him as if he were behind the glass wall.\n",
            "   He began to put on his clothes, moving restlessly about the bedroom. “Yes, and it might be a good idea. Before I hurt someone. Did you hear Beatty? Did you listen to him? He knows all the answers. Hes right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept sitting there saying to myself, Im not happy, Im not happy.”\n",
            "   “I am.” Mildreds mouth beamed. “And proud of it.”\n",
            "   “Im going to do something,” said Montag. “I dont even know what yet, but Im going to do something big.”\n",
            "   “Im tired of listening to this junk,” said Mildred, turning from him to the announcer again\n",
            "   Montag touched the volume control in the wall and the announcer was speechless.\n",
            "   “Millie?” He paused. “This is your house as well as mine. I feel its only fair that I tell you something now. I should have told you before, but I wasnt even admitting it to myself. I have something I want you to see, something Ive put away and hid during the past year, now and again, once in a while, I didnt know why, but I did it and I never told you.”\n",
            "   He took hold of a straight?backed chair and moved it slowly and steadily into the hall near the front door and climbed up on it and stood for a moment like a statue on a pedestal, his wife standing under him, waiting. Then he reached up and pulled back the grille of the air?conditioning system and reached far back inside to the right and moved still another sliding sheet of metal and took out a book. Without looking at it he dropped it to the floor. He put his hand back up and took out two books and moved his hand down and dropped the two books to the floor. He kept moving his hand and dropping books, small ones, fairly large ones, yellow, red, green ones. When he was done he looked down upon some twenty books lying at his wifes feet.\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” he said. “I didnt really think. But now it looks as if were in this together.”\n",
            "   Mildred backed away as if she were suddenly confronted by a pack of mice that had come up out of the floor. He could hear her breathing rapidly and her face was paled out and her eyes were fastened wide. She said his name over, twice, three times. Then moaning, she ran forward, seized a book and ran toward the kitchen incinerator.\n",
            "   He caught her, shrieking. He held her and she tried to fight away from him, scratching.\n",
            "   “No, Millie, no! Wait! Stop it, will you? You dont know... stop it!” He slapped her face, he grabbed her again and shook her.\n",
            "   She said his name and began to cry.\n",
            "   “Millie!” he said. “Listen. Give me a second, will you? We cant do anything. We cant burn these. I want to look at them, at least look at them once. Then if what the Captain says is true, well burn them together, believe me, well burn them together. You must help me.” He looked down into her face and took hold of her chin and held her firmly. He was looking not only at her, but for himself and what he must do, in her face. “Whether we like this or not, were in it. Ive never asked for much from you in all these years, but I ask it now, I plead for it. Weve got to start somewhere here, figuring out why were in such a mess, you and the medicine at night, and the car, and me and my work. Were heading right for the cliff, Millie. God, I dont want to go over. This isnt going to be easy. We havent anything to go on, but maybe we can piece it out and figure it and help each other. I need you so much right now, I cant tell you. If you love me at all youll put up with this, twenty?four, forty?eight hours, thats all I ask, then itll be over. I promise, I swear! And if there is something here, just one little thing out of a whole mess of things, maybe we can pass it on to someone else.”\n",
            "   She wasnt fighting any more, so he let her go. She sagged away from him and slid down the wall, and sat on the floor looking at the books. Her foot touched one and she saw this and pulled her foot away.\n",
            "   “That woman, the other night, Millie, you werent there. You didnt see her face. And Clarisse. You never talked to her. I talked to her. And men like Beatty are afraid of her. I cant understand it. Why should they be so afraid of someone like her? But I kept putting her alongside the firemen in the house last night, and I suddenly realized I didnt like them at all, and I didnt like myself at all any more. And I thought maybe it would be best if the firemen themselves were burnt.”\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   The front door voice called softly:\n",
            "   “Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here, someone here, Mrs. Montag, Mrs. Montag, someone here.”\n",
            "   Softly.\n",
            "   They turned to stare at the door and the books toppled everywhere, everywhere in heaps.\n",
            "   “Beatty!” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “It cant be him.”\n",
            "   “Hes come back!” she whispered.\n",
            "   The front door voice called again softly. “Someone here...”\n",
            "   “We wont answer.” Montag lay back against the wall and then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books, bewilderedly, with his thumb, his forefinger. He was shivering and he wanted above all to shove the books up through the ventilator again, but he knew he could not face Beatty again. He crouched and then he sat and the voice of the front door spoke again, more insistently. Montag picked a single small volume from the floor. “Where do we begin?” He opened the book half?way and peered at it. “We begin by beginning, I guess.”\n",
            "   “Hell come in,” said Mildred, “and burn us and the books!”\n",
            "   The front door voice faded at last. There was a silence. Montag felt the presence of someone beyond the door, waiting, listening. Then the footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn.\n",
            "   “Lets see what this is,” said Montag.\n",
            "   He spoke the words haltingly and with a terrible selfconsciousness. He read a dozen pages here and there and came at last to this:\n",
            "   “It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death rather than submit to break eggs at the smaller end.”\n",
            "   Mildred sat across the hall from him. “What does it mean? It doesnt mean anything! The Captain was right!”\n",
            "   “Here now,” said Montag. “Well start over again, at the beginning.”\n",

            "   THEY read the long afternoon through, while the cold November rain fell from the sky upon the quiet house. They sat in the hall because the parlour was so empty and grey-looking without its walls lit with orange and yellow confetti and sky-rockets and women in gold-mesh dresses and men in black velvet pulling one-hundred-pound rabbits from silver hats. The parlour was dead and Mildred kept peering in at it with a blank expression as Montag paced the floor and came back and squatted down and read a page as many as ten times, aloud.\n",
            "   “We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over, so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.”\n",

            "   “Is that what it was in the girl  door? Ive tried so hard to figure.”\n",
            "   “Shes dead. Lets talk about someone alive, for goodness’ sake.”\n",
            "   Montag did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along the hall to the kitchen, where he stood a long. time watching the rain hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the grey light, waiting for the tremble to subside.\n",
            "   He opened another book.\n",
            "   “That favourite subject, Myself.”\n",
            "   He squinted at the wall. “The favourite subject, Myself.”\n",
            "   “I understand that one,” said Mildred.\n",
            "   “But Clarisses favourite subject wasnt herself. It was everyone else, and me. She was the first person in a good many years Ive really liked. She was the first person I can remember who looked straight at me as if I counted.” He lifted the two books. “These men have been dead a long time, but I know their words point, one way or another, to Clansse.”\n",
            "   Outside the front door, in the rain, a faint scratching.\n",
            "   Montag froze. He saw Mildred thrust herself back to the wall and gasp.\n",
            "   “I shut it off.”\n",
            "   “Someone—the door—why doesnt the door-voice tell us—”\n",
            "   Under the door-sill, a slow, probing sniff, an exhalation of electric steam.\n",
            "   Mildred laughed. “Its only a dog, thats what! You want me to shoo him away?”\n",
            "   “Stay where you are!”\n",
            "   Silence. The cold rain falling. And the smell of blue electricity blowing under the locked door.\n",
            "   “Lets get back to work,” said Montag quietly.\n",
            "   Mildred kicked at a book. “Books arent people. You read and I look around, but there isnt anybody!”\n",
            "   He stared at the parlour that was dead and grey as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun.\n",
            "   “Now,” said Mildred, “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh! And the colours!”\n",
            "   “Yes, I know.”\n",
            "   “And besides, if Captain Beatty knew about those books—” She thought about it. Her face grew amazed and then horrified. “He might come and bum the house and the ‘family.’ Thats awful! Think of our investment. Why should I read? What for?”\n",
            "   “What for! Why!” said Montag. “I saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. It was dead but it was alive. It could see but it couldnt see. You want to see that snake. Its at Emergency Hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! Would you like to go and check their file? Maybe youd look under Guy Montag or maybe under Fear or War. Would you like to go to that house that burnt last night? And rake ashes for the bones of the woman who set fire to her own house! What about Clarisse McClellan, where do we look for her? The morgue! Listen!”\n",
            "   The bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house, gasping, murmuring, whistling like an immense, invisible fan, circling in emptiness.\n",
            "   “Jesus God,” said Montag. “Every hour so many damn things in the sky! How in hell did those bombers get up there every single second of our lives! Why doesnt someone want to talk about it? Weve started and won two atomic wars since 1960. Is it because were having so much fun at home weve forgotten the world? Is it because were so rich and the rest of the worlds so poor and we just dont care if they are? Ive heard rumours; the world is starving, but were well-fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why were hated so much? Ive heard the rumours about hate, too, once in a long while, over the years. Do you know why? I dont, thats sure! Maybe the books can get us half out of the cave. They just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes! I dont hear those idiot bastards in your parlour talking about it. God, Millie, dont you see? An hour a day, two hours, with these books, and maybe...”\n",
            "   The telephone rang. Mildred snatched the phone.\n",
            "   “Ann!” She laughed. “Yes, the White Clowns on tonight!”\n",
            "   Montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down. “Montag,” he said, “youre really stupid. Where do we go from here? Do we turn the books in, forget it?” He opened the book to read over Mildreds laughter.\n",
            "   Poor Millie, he thought. Poor Montag, its mud to you, too. But where do you get help, where do you find a teacher this late?\n",
            "   Hold on. He shut his eyes. Yes, of course. Again he found himself thinking of the green park a year ago. The thought had been with him many times recently, but now he remembered how it was that day in the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide something, quickly in his coat .\n",
            "   ...The old man leapt up as if to run. And Montag said, “Wait!”\n",
            "   “I havent done anything!” cried the old man trembling.\n",
            "   “No one said you did.”\n",
            "   They had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a moment, and then Montag talked about the weather, and then the old man responded with a pale voice. It was a strange quiet meeting. The old man admitted to being a retired English professor who had been thrown out upon the world forty years ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and patronage. His name was Faber, and when he finally lost his fear of Montag, he talked in a cadenced voice, looking at the sky and the trees and the green park, and when an hour had passed he said something to Montag and Montag sensed it was a rhymeless poem. Then the old man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was a poem, too. Faber held his hand over his left coat-pocket and spoke these words gently, and Montag knew if he reached out, he might pull a book of poetry from the mans coat. But he did not reach out. His. hands stayed on his knees, numbed and useless. “I dont talk things, sir,” said Faber. “I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know Im alive.”\n",
            "   That was all there was to it, really. An hour of monologue, a poem, a comment, and then without even acknowledging the fact that Montag was a fireman, Faber with a certain trembling, wrote his address on a slip of paper. “For your file,” he said, “in case you decide to be angry with me.”\n",
            "   “Im not angry,” Montag said, surprised.\n",
            "   Mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall.\n",
            "   Montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his file-wallet to the heading: FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS (?). Fabers name was there. He hadnt turned it in and he hadnt erased it.\n",
            "   He dialled the call on a secondary phone. The phone on the far end of the line called Fabers name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice. Montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence. “Yes, Mr. Montag?”\n",
            "   “Professor Faber, I have a rather odd question to ask. How many copies of the Bible are left in this country?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what youre talking about!”\n",
            "   “I want to know if there are any copies left at all.”\n",
            "   “This is some sort of a trap! I cant talk to just anyone on the phone!”\n",
            "   “How many copies of Shakespeare and Plato?”\n",
            "   “None! You know as well as I do. None!”\n",
            "   Faber hung up.\n",
            "   Montag put down the phone. None. A thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings. But somehow he had wanted to hear it from Faber himself.\n",
            "   In the hall Mildreds face was suffused with excitement. “Well, the ladies are coming over!”\n",
            "   Montag showed her a book. “This is the Old and New Testament, and-”\n",
            "   “Dont start that again!”\n",
            "   “It might be the last copy in this part of the world.”\n",
            "   “Youve got to hand it back tonight, dont you know? Captain Beatty knows youve got it, doesnt he?”\n",
            "   “I dont think he knows which book I stole. But how do I choose a substitute? Do I turn in Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Thoreau? Which is least valuable? If I pick a substitute and Beatty does know which book I stole, hell guess weve an entire library here!”\n",
            "   Mildreds mouth twitched. “See what youre doing? Youll ruin us! Whos more important, me or that Bible?” She was beginning to shriek now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat.\n",
            "   He could hear Beattys voice. “Sit down, Montag. Watch. Delicately, like the petals of a flower. Light the first page, light the second page. Each becomes a black butterfly. Beautiful, eh? Light the third page from the second and so on, chainsmoking, chapter by chapter, all the silly things the words mean, all the false promises, all the second-hand notions and time-worn philosophies.” There sat Beatty, perspiring gently, the floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm\n",
            "   Mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started. Montag was not listening. “Theres only one thing to do,” he said. “Some time before tonight when I give the book to Beatty, Ive got to have a duplicate made.”\n",
            "   “Youll be here for the White Clown tonight, and the ladies coming over?” cried Mildred.\n",
            "   Montag stopped at the door, with his back turned. “Millie?”\n",
            "   A silence “What?”\n",
            "   “Millie? Does the White Clown love you?”\n",
            "   No answer.\n",
            "   “Millie, does—” He licked his lips. “Does your ‘family’ love you, love you very much, love you with all their heart\n",
            "   and soul, Millie?”\n",
            "   He felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck.\n",
            "   “Whyd you ask a silly question like that?”\n",
            "   He felt he wanted to cry, but nothing would happen to his eyes or his mouth.\n",
            "   “If you see that dog outside,” said Mildred, “give him a kick for me.”\n",
            "   He hesitated, listening at the door. He opened it and stepped out.\n",
            "   The rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky. The street and the lawn and the porch were empty. He let his breath go in a great sigh.\n",
            "   He slammed the door.\n",
            "   He was on the subway.\n",
            "   Im numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill-bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\n",
            "   The numbness will go away, he thought. Itll take time, but Ill do it, or Faber will do it for me. Someone somewhere will give me back the old face and the old hands the way they were. Even the smile, he thought, the old burnt-in smile, thats gone. Im lost without it.\n",
            "   The subway fled past him, cream-tile, jet-black, cream-tile, jet-black, numerals and darkness, more darkness and the total adding itself.\n",
            "   Once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the middle of the blue and hot summer day, trying to fill a sieve with sand, because some cruel cousin had said, “Fill this sieve and youll get a dime!” And the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through with a hot whispering. His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty. Seated there in the midst of July, without a sound, he felt the tears move down his cheeks.\n",
            "   Now as the vacuum-underground rushed him through the dead cellars of town, jolting him, he remembered the terrible logic of that sieve, and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the Bible open. There were people in the suction train but he held the book in his hands and the silly thought came to him, if you read fast and read all, maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve. But he read and the words fell through, and he thought, in a few hours, there will be Beatty, and here will be me handing this over, so no phrase must escape me, each line must be memorized. I will myself to do it.\n",
            "   He clenched the book in his fists.\n",
            "   Trumpets blared.\n",

The people who had been sitting a moment before, tapping their feet to the rhythm of Denhams Dentifrice, Denhams Dandy Dental Detergent, Denhams Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice, one two, one two three, one two, one two three. The people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the words Dentifrice Dentifrice Dentifrice. The train radio vomited upon Montag, in retaliation, a great ton-load of music made of tin, copper, silver, chromium, and brass. The people wcre pounded into submission; they did not run, there was no place to run; the great air-train fell down its shaft in the earth.\n",

Only then. did he leap past the other passengers, screaming in his mind, plunge through the slicing door only in time. He ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels, ignoring the escalators, because he wanted to feel his feet-move, arms swing, lungs clench, unclench, feel his throat go raw with air. A voice drifted after him, “Denhams Denhams Denhams,” the train hissed like a snake. The train vanished in its hole.\n",

The old man looked as if he had not been out of the house in years. He and the white plaster walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded, with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the book under Montags arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile. Slowly his fear went.\n",
            "   “Im sorry. One has to be careful.”\n",
            "   He looked at the book under Montags arm and could not stop. “So its true.”\n",
            "   Montag stepped inside. The door shut.\n",
            "   “Sit down.” Faber backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desk-top. Montag had only a glimpse, before Faber, seeing Montags attention diverted, turned quickly and shut the bedroom door and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand. His gaze returned unsteadily to Montag, who was now seated with the book in his lap. “The book-where did you-?”\n",
            "   “I stole it.”\n",
            "   Faber, for the first time, raised his eyes and looked directly into Montags face. “Youre brave.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Montag. “My wifes dying. A friend of mines already dead. Someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twenty-four hours ago. Youre the only one I knew might help me. To see. To see..”\n",
            "   Fabers hands itched on his knees. “May I?”\n",
            "   “Sorry.” Montag gave him the book.\n",
            "   “Its been a long time. Im not a religious man. But its been a long time.” Faber turned the pages, stopping here and there to read. “Its as good as I remember. Lord, how theyve changed itin our ‘parlours’ these days. Christ is one of the ‘family’ now. I often wonder it God recognizes His own son the way weve dressed him up, or is it dressed him down? Hes a regular peppermint stick now, all sugar-crystal and saccharine when he isnt making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs.” Faber sniffed the book. “Do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land? I loved to smell them when I was a boy. Lord, there were a lot of lovely books once, before we let them go.” Faber turned the pages. “Mr. Montag, you are looking at a coward. I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. Im one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the ‘guilty,’ but I did not speak and thus became guilty myself. And when finally they set the structure to burn the books, using the, firemen, I grunted a few times and subsided, for there were no others grunting or yelling with me, by then. Now, its too late.” Faber closed the Bible. “Well—suppose you tell me why you came here?”\n",
            "   “Nobody listens any more. I cant talk to the walls because theyre yelling at me. I cant talk to my wife; she listens to the walls. I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, itll make sense. And I want you to teach me to understand what I read.”\n",
            "   Faber examined Montags thin, blue-jowled face. “How did you get shaken up? What knocked the torch out of your hands?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we arent happy. Somethings missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books Id burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.”\n",
            "   “Youre a hopeless romantic,” said Faber. “It would be funny if it were not serious. Its not books you need, its some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the ‘parlour families’ today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, its not books at all youre looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldnt know this, of course you still cant understand what I mean when I say all this. You are intuitively right, thats what counts. Three things are missing.\n",
            "   “Number one: Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. Youd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. Thats my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\n",
            "   “So now do you see why books are hated and feared? They show the pores in the face of life. The comfortable people want only wax moon faces, poreless, hairless, expressionless. We are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers, instead of growing on good rain and black loam. Even fireworks, for all their prettiness, come from the chemistry of the earth. Yet somehow we think we can grow, feeding on flowers and fireworks, without completing the cycle back to reality. Do you know the legend of Hercules and Antaeus, the giant wrestler, whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth. But when he was held, rootless, in mid-air, by Hercules, he perished easily. If there isnt something in that legend for us today, in this city, in our time, then I am completely insane. Well, there we have the first thing I said we needed. Quality, texture of information.”\n",

            "   “Oh, but weve plenty of off-hours.”\n",
            "   “Off-hours, yes. But time to think? If youre not driving a hundred miles an hour, at a clip where you cant think of anything else but the danger, then youre playing some game or sitting in some room where you cant argue with the fourwall televisor. Why? The televisor is ‘real.’ It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be, right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasnt time to protest, ‘What nonsense!”\n",
            "   “Only the ‘family’ is ‘people.’”\n",
            "   “I beg your pardon?”\n",

            "   “Thank God for that. You can shut them, say, ‘Hold on a moment.’ You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlour? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is the truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and scepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full colour, three dimensions, and I being in and part of those incredible parlours. As you see, my parlour is nothing but four plaster walls. And here” He held out two small rubber plugs. “For my ears when I ride the subway-jets.”\n",
            "   “Denhams Dentifrice; they toil not, neither do they spin,” said Montag, eyes shut. “Where do we go from here? Would books help us?”\n",
            "   “Only if the third necessary thing could be given us. Number one, as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the inter-action of the first two. And I hardly think a very old man and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game...”\n",

            "   “There, youve said an interesting thing,” laughed Faber, “without having read it!”\n",
            "   “Are things like that in books. But it came off the top of my mind!”\n",
            "   “All the better. You didnt fancy it up for me or anyone, even yourself.”\n",
            "   Montag leaned forward. “This afternoon I thought that if it turned out that books were worth while, we might get a press and print some extra copies—”\n",
            "   “ We?”\n",
            "   “You and I”\n",
            "   “Oh, no!” Faber sat up.\n",

            "   “Not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for my trouble. The only way I could possibly listen to you would be if somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt. Now if you suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in firemens houses all over the country, so that seeds of suspicion would be sown among these arsonists, bravo, Id say!”\n",
            "   “Plant the books, turn in an alarm, and see the firemens houses bum, is that what you mean?”\n",
            "   Faber raised his brows and looked at Montag as if he were seeing a new man. “I was joking.”\n",
            "   “If you thought it would be a plan worth trying, Id have to take your word it would help.”\n",
            "   “You cant guarantee things like that! After all, when we had all the books we needed, we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to jump off. But we do need a breather. We do need knowledge. And perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off. The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are. Theyre Caesars praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, ‘Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.’ Most of us cant rush around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we havent time, money or that many friends. The things youre looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Dont ask for guarantees. And dont look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.”\n",
            "   Faber got up and began to pace the room.\n",

            "   “Absolutely.”\n",
            "   “Its an insidious plan, if I do say so myself.” Faber glanced nervously at his bedroom door. “To see the firehouses burn across the land, destroyed as hotbeds of treason. The salamander devours his tail! Ho, God!”\n",
            "   “Ive a list of firemens residences everywhere. With some sort of underground”\n",

            "   “Oh, there are many actors alone who havent acted Pirandello or Shaw or Shakespeare for years because their plays are too aware of the world. We could use their anger. And we could use the honest rage of those historians who havent written a line for forty years. True, we might form classes in thinking and reading.”\n",
            "   “Yes!”\n",

Good God, it isnt as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord. You firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze, but its a small sideshow indeed, and hardly necessary to keep things in line. So few want to be rebels any more. And out of those few, most, like myself, scare easily. Can you dance faster than the White Clown, shout louder than ‘Mr. Gimmick’ and the parlour ‘families’? If you can, youll win your way, Montag. In any event, youre a fool. People are having fun”\n",

That was the year I came to class at the start of the new semester and found only one student to sign up for Drama from Aeschylus to ONeill. You see? How like a beautiful statue of ice it was, melting in the sun. I remember the newspapers dying like huge moths. No one wanted them back. No one missed them. And the Government, seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about passionate lips and the fist in the stomach, circled the situation with your fire-eaters. So, Montag, theres this unemployed printer. We might start a few books, and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us the push we need. A few bombs and the ‘families’ in the walls of all the houses, like harlequin rats, will shut up! In silence, our stage-whisper might carry.”\n",

Only a week ago, pumping a kerosene hose, I thought: God, what fun!”\n",

Well, I played the market and built all this and Ive waited. Ive waited, trembling, half a lifetime for someone to speak to me. I dared speak to no one. That day in the park when we sat together, I knew that some day you might drop by, with fire or friendship, it was hard to guess. Ive had this little item ready for months. But I almost let you go, Im that afraid!”\n",

            "   “And something more! It listens! If you put it in your ear, Montag, I can sit comfortably home, warming my frightened bones, and hear and analyse the firemens world, find its weaknesses, without danger. Im the Queen Bee, safe in the hive. You will be the drone, the travelling ear. Eventually, I could put out ears into all parts of the city, with various men, listening and evaluating. If the drones die, Im still safe at home, tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of chance. See how safe I play it, how contemptible I am?”\n",

Lets listen to this Captain Beatty together. He could be one of us. God knows. Ill give you things to say. Well give him a good show. Do you hate me for this electronic cowardice of mine?

            "   “Would you like me to read? Ill read so you can remember. I go to bed only five hours a night. Nothing to do. So if you like; Ill read you to sleep nights. They say you retain knowledge even when youre sleeping, if someone whispers it in your ear.”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “Here.” Far away across town in the night, the faintest whisper of a turned page. “The Book of Job.”\n",
            "   The moon rose in the sky as Montag walked, his lips moving just a trifle.\n",
            "   He was eating a light supper at nine in the evening when the front door cried out in the hall and Mildred ran from the parlour like a native fleeing an eruption of Vesuvius. Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came through the front door and vanished into the volcanos mouth with martinis in their hands: Montag stopped eating. They were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw their Cheshire Cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and now they were screaming at each other above the din. Montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his mouth.\n",
            "   “Doesnt everyone look nice!”\n",
            "   “Nice.”\n",
            "   “You look fine, Millie!”\n",
            "   “Fine.”\n",
            "   “Everyone looks swell.”\n",
            "   “Swell!\n",
            "   “Montag stood watching them.\n",
            "   “Patience,” whispered Faber.\n",
            "   “I shouldnt be here,” whispered Montag, almost to himself. “I should be on my way back to you with the money!” “Tomorrows time enough. Careful!”\n",
            "   “Isnt this show wonderful?” cried Mildred. “Wonderful!”\n",
            "   On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought Montag, insanely. In the other walls an X-ray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delightful stomach! Abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into the clouds, it plunged into a lime-green sea where blue fish ate red and yellow fish. A minute later, Three White Cartoon Clowns chopped off each others limbs to the accompaniment of immense incoming tides of laughter. Two minutes more and the room whipped out of town to the jet cars wildly circling an arena, bashing and backing up and bashing each other again. Montag saw a number of bodies fly in the air.\n",
            "   “Millie, did you see that?”\n",
            "   “I saw it, I saw it!”\n",
            "   Montag reached inside the parlour wall and pulled the main switch. The images drained away, as if the water had been let out from a gigantic crystal bowl of hysterical fish.\n",
            "   The three women turned slowly and looked with unconcealed irritation and then dislike at Montag.\n",
            "   “When do you suppose the war will start?” he said. “I notice your husbands arent here tonight?”\n",
            "   “Oh, they come and go, come and go,” said Mrs. Phelps. “In again out again Finnegan, the Army called Pete yesterday. Hell be back  week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and everyone home. Thats what the Army said. Quick war. Pete was called yesterday and they said hed be, back  week. Quick...”\n",
            "   The three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty mud-coloured walls.\n",
            "   “Im not worried,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Ill let Pete do all the worrying.” She giggled. “Ill let old Pete do all the worrying. Not me. Im not worried.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” said Millie. “Let old Pete do the worrying.”\n",
            "   “Its always someone elses husband dies, they say.”\n",
            "   “Ive heard that, too. Ive never known any dead man killed in a war. Killed jumping off buildings, yes, like Glorias husband last week, but from wars? No.”\n",
            "   “Not from wars,” said Mrs. Phelps. “Anyway, Pete and I always said, no tears, nothing like that. Its our third marriage each and were independent. Be independent, we always said. He said, if I get killed off, you just go right ahead and dont cry, but get married again, and dont think of me.”\n",
            "   “That reminds me,” said Mildred. “Did you see that Clara Dove five-minute romance last night in your wall? Well, it was all about this woman who—”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but stood looking at the womens faces as he had once looked at the faces of saints in a strange church he had entered when he was a child. The faces of those enamelled creatures meant nothing to him, though he talked to them and stood in that church for a long time, trying to be of that religion, trying to know what that religion was, trying to get enough of the raw incense and special dust of the place into his lungs and thus into his blood to feel touched and concerned by the meaning of the colourful men and women with the porcelain eyes and the blood-ruby lips. But there was nothing, nothing; it was a stroll through another store, and his currency strange and unusable there, and his passion cold, even when he touched the wood and plaster and clay. So it was now, in his own parlour, with these women twisting in their chairs under his gaze, lighting cigarettes, blowing smoke, touching their sun-fired hair and examining their blazing fingernails as if they had caught fire from his look. Their faces grew haunted with silence. They leaned forward at the sound of Montags swallowing his final bite of food. They listened to his feverish breathing. The three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows of sleeping giants now, empty of dreams. Montag felt that if you touched these three staring brows you would feel a fine salt sweat on your finger-tips. The perspiration gathered with the silence and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with tension. Any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode.\n",
            "   Montag moved his lips.\n",
            "   “Lets talk.”\n",
            "   The women jerked and stared.\n",
            "   “Howre your children, Mrs. Phelps?” he asked.\n",
            "   “You know I havent any! No one in his right mind, the Good Lord knows; would have children!” said Mrs. Phelps, not quite sure why she was angry with this man.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt say that,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Ive had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and thats nice. Two Caesarians tamed the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians arent necessary; youve got the, hips for it, everythings normal, but I insisted.”\n",
            "   “Caesarians or not, children are ruinous; youre out of your mind,” said Mrs. Phelps.\n",
            "   “I plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. I put up with them when they come home three days a month; its not bad at all. You heave them into the ‘parlour’ and turn the switch. Its like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid.” Mrs. Bowles tittered. “Theyd just as soon kick as kiss me. Thank God, I can kick back!”\n",
            "   The women showed their tongues, laughing.\n",
            "   Mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that Montag was still in the doorway, clapped her hands. “Lets talk politics, to please Guy!”\n",
            "   “Sounds fine,” said Mrs. Bowles. “I voted last election, same as everyone, and I laid it on the line for President Noble. I think hes one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president.”\n",
            "   “Oh, but the man they ran against him!”\n",
            "   “He wasnt much, was he? Kind of small and homely and he didnt shave too close or comb his hair very well.”\n",
            "   “What possessed the ‘Outs’ to run him? You just dont go running a little short man like that against a tall man. Besides -he mumbled. Half the time I couldnt hear a word he said. And the words I did hear I didnt understand!”\n",
            "   “Fat, too, and didnt dress to hide it. No wonder the landslide was for Winston Noble. Even their names helped. Compare Winston Noble to Hubert Hoag for ten seconds and you can almost figure the results.”\n",
            "   “Damn it!” cried Montag. “What do you know about Hoag and Noble?”\n",
            "   “Why, they were right in that parlour wall, not six months ago. One was always picking his nose; it drove me wild.”\n",
            "   “Well, Mr. Montag,” said Mrs. Phelps, “do you want us to vote for a man like that?”\n",
            "   Mildred beamed. “You just run away from the door, Guy, and dont make us nervous.”\n",
            "   But Montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his hand.\n",
            "   “Guy!”\n",
            "   “Damn it all, damn it all, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Whatve you got there; isnt that a book? I thought that all special training these days was done by film.” Mrs. Phelps blinked. “You reading up on fireman theory?”\n",
            "   “Theory, hell,” said Montag. “Its poetry.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” A whisper.\n",
            "   “Leave me alone!” Montag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum.\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on, dont...”\n",
            "   “Did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about monsters? Oh God, the way they jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their husbands and the way they talk about war, dammit, I stand here and I cant believe it!”\n",
            "   “I didnt say a single word about any war, Ill have you know,” said Mrs, Phelps.\n",
            "   “As for poetry, I hate it,” said Mrs. Bowles.\n",
            "   “Have you ever read any?”\n",
            "   “Montag,” Fabers voice scraped away at him. “Youll ruin everything. Shut up, you fool!”\n",
            "   “All three women were on their feet.\n",
            "   “Sit down!”\n",
            "   They sat.\n",
            "   “Im going home,” quavered Mrs. Bowles.\n",
            "   “Montag, Montag, please, in the name of God, what are you up to?” pleaded Faber.\n",
            "   “Why dont you just read us one of those poems from your little book,” Mrs. Phelps nodded. “I think thatd he very interesting.”\n",
            "   “Thats not right,” wailed Mrs. Bowles. “We cant do that!”\n",
            "   “Well, look at Mr. Montag, he wants to, I know he does. And if we listen nice, Mr. Montag will be happy and then maybe we can go on and do something else.” She glanced nervously at the long emptiness of the walls enclosing them.\n",
            "   “Montag, go through with this and Ill cut off, Ill leave.” The beetle jabbed his ear. “What good is this, whatll you prove?”\n",
            "   “Scare hell out of them, thats what, scare the living daylights out!”\n",
            "   Mildred looked at the empty air. “Now Guy, just who are you talking to?”\n",
            "   A silver needle pierced his brain. “Montag, listen, only one way out, play it as a joke, cover up, pretend you arent mad at all. Then-walk to your wall-incinerator, and throw the book in!”\n",
            "   Mildred had already anticipated this in a quavery voice. “Ladies, once a year, every firemans allowed to bring one book home, from the old days, to show his family how silly it all was, how nervous that sort of thing can make you, how crazy. Guys surprise tonight is to read you one sample to show how mixed-up things were, so none of us will ever have to bother our little old heads about that junk again, isnt that right, darling?”\n",
            "   He crushed the book in his fists. “Say ‘yes.’”\n",
            "   His mouth moved like Fabers.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Mildred snatched the book with a laugh. “Here! Read this one. No, I take it back. Heres that real funny one you read out loud today. Ladies, you wont understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go ahead, Guy, that page, dear.”\n",
            "   He looked at the opened page.\n",
            "   A fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. “Read.”\n",
            "   “Whats the title, dear?”\n",
            "   “Dover Beach.” His mouth was numb.\n",
            "   “Now read in a nice clear voice and go slow.”\n",
            "   The room was blazing hot, he was all fire, he was all coldness; they sat in the middle of an empty desert with three chairs and him standing, swaying, and him waiting for Mrs. Phelps to stop straightening her dress hem and Mrs. Bowles to take her fingers away from her hair. Then he began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there in the great hot emptiness:\n",
            "   “The Sea of Faith\n",
            "   Was once, too, at the full, and round earths shore\n",
            "   Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\n",
            "   But now I only hear\n",
            "   Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,\n",
            "   Retreating, to the breath\n",
            "   Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear\n",
            "   And naked shingles of the world.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The chairs creaked under the three women. Montag finished it out:\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Ah, love, let us be true\n",
            "   To one another! for the world, which seems\n",
            "   To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n",
            "   So various, so beautiful, so new,\n",
            "   Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n",
            "   Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;\n",
            "   And we are here as on a darkling plain\n",
            "   Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\n",
            "   Where ignorant armies clash by night.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Mrs. Phelps was crying.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed itself out of shape. They sat, not touching her, bewildered by her display. She sobbed uncontrollably. Montag himself was stunned and shaken.\n",
            "   “Sh, sh,” said Mildred. “Youre all right, Clara, now, Clara, snap out of it! Clara, whats wrong?”\n",
            "   “I-I,”, sobbed Mrs. Phelps, “dont know, dont know, I just dont know, oh oh...”\n",
            "   Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. “You see? I knew it, thats what I wanted to prove! I knew it would happen! Ive always said, poetry and tears, poetry and suicide and crying and awful feelings, poetry and sickness; all that mush! Now Ive had it proved to me. Youre nasty, Mr. Montag, youre nasty!”\n",
            "   Faber said, “Now...”\n",
            "   Montag felt himself turn and walk to the wall-slot and drop the book in through the brass notch to the waiting flames.\n",
            "   “Silly words, silly words, silly awful hurting words,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Why do people want to hurt people? Not enough hurt in the world, youve got to tease people with stuff like that!”\n",
            "   “Clara, now, Clara,” begged Mildred, pulling her arm. “Come on, lets be cheery, you turn the ‘family’ on, now. Go ahead. Lets laugh and be happy, now, stop crying, well have a party!”\n",
            "   “No,” said Mrs. Bowles. “Im trotting right straight home. You want to visit my house and ‘family,’ well and good. But I wont come in this firemans crazy house again in my lifetime!”\n",
            "   “Go home.” Montag fixed his eyes upon her, quietly. “Go home and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, go home and think of the dozen abortions youve had, go home and think of that and your damn Caesarian sections, too, and your children who hate your guts! Go home and think how it all happened and what did you ever do to stop it? Go home, go home!” he yelled. “Before I knock you down and kick you out of the door!”\n",
            "   Doors slammed and the house was empty. Montag stood alone in the winter weather, with the parlour walls the colour of dirty snow.\n",
            "   In the bathroom, water ran. He heard Mildred shake the sleeping tablets into her hand.\n",
            "   “Fool, Montag, fool, fool, oh God you silly fool...”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” He pulled the green bullet from his ear and jammed it into his pocket.\n",
            "   It sizzled faintly. “...fool... fool...”\n",
            "   He searched the house and found the books where Mildred had stacked them behind the refrigerator. Some were missing and he knew that she had started on her own slow process of dispersing the dynamite in her house, stick by stick. But he was not angry now, only exhausted and bewildered with himself. He carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning.\n",
            "   He went back through the house. “Mildred?” He called at the door of the darkened bedroom. There was no sound.\n",
            "   Outside, crossing the lawn, on his way to work, he tried not to see how completely dark and deserted Clarisse McClellans house was...\n",
            "   On the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the night. Already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known Faber a lifetime. Now he knew that he was two people, that he was above all Montag, who knew nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it. And he knew that he was also the old man who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one end of the night city to the other on one long sickening gasp of motion. In the days to follow, and in the nights when there was no moon and in the nights when there was a very bright moon shining on the earth, the old man would go on with this talking and this talking, drop by drop, stone by stone, flake by flake. His mind would well over at last and he would not be Montag any more, this the old man told him, assured him, promised him. He would be Montag-plus-Faber, fire plus water, and then, one day, after everything had mixed and simmered and worked away in silence, there would be neither fire nor water, but wine. Out of two separate and opposite things, a third. And one day he would look back upon the fool and know the fool. Even now he could feel the start of the long journey, the leave-taking, the going away from the self he had been.\n",
            "   It was good listening to the beetle hum, the sleepy mosquito buzz and delicate filigree murmur of the old mans voice at first scolding him and then consoling him in the late hour of night as he emerged from the steaming subway toward the firehouse world.\n",
            "   “Pity, Montag, pity. Dont haggle and nag them; you were so recently one o f them yourself. They are so confident that they will run on for ever. But they wont run on. They dont know that this is all one huge big blazing meteor that makes a pretty fire in space, but that some day itll have to hit. They see only the blaze, the pretty fire, as you saw it.\n",
            "   “Montag, old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanut-brittle bones, have no right to criticize. Yet you almost killed things at the start. Watch it! Im with you, remember that. I understand how it happened. I must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. God, how young I felt! But now-I want you to feel old, I want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you tonight. The  few hours, when you see Captain Beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for you, let me feel the situation out. Survival is our ticket. Forget the poor, silly women...”\n",
            "   “I made them unhappier than they have been in years, Ithink,” said Montag. “It shocked me to see Mrs. Phelps cry. Maybe theyre right, maybe its best not to face things, to run, have fun. I dont know. I feel guilty—”\n",
            "   “No, you mustnt! If there were no war, if there was peace in the world, Id say fine, have fun! But, Montag, you mustnt go back to being just a fireman. All isnt well with the world.”\n",
            "   Montag perspired.\n",
            "   “Montag, you listening?”\n",
            "   “My feet,” said Montag. “I cant move them. I feel so damn silly. My feet wont move!”\n",
            "   “Listen. Easy now,” said the old man gently. “I know, I know. Youre afraid of making mistakes. Dont be. Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in peoples faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and youll never learn. Now, pick up your feet, into the firehouse with you! Were twins, were not alone any more, were not separated out in different parlours, with no contact between. If you need help when Beatty pries at you, Ill be sitting right here in your eardrum making notes!”\n",
            "   Montag felt his right foot, then his left foot, move.\n",
            "   “Old man,” he said, “stay with me.”\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound was gone. Its kennel was empty and the firehouse stood all about in plaster silence and the orange Salamander slept with its kerosene in its belly and the firethrowers crossed upon its flanks and Montag came in through the silence and touched the brass pole and slid up in the dark air, looking back at the deserted kennel, his heart beating, pausing, beating. Faber was a grey moth asleep in his ear, for the moment.\n",
            "   Beatty stood near the drop-hole waiting, but with his back turned as if he were not waiting.\n",
            "   “Well,” he said to the men playing cards, “here comes a very strange beast which in all tongues is called a fool.”\n",
            "   He put his hand to one side, palm up, for a gift. Montag put the book in it. Without even glancing at the title, Beatty tossed the book into the trash-basket and lit a cigarette. “‘Who are a little wise, the best fools be.’ Welcome back, Montag. I hope youll be staying, with us, now that your fever is done and your sickness over. Sit in for a hand of poker?”\n",
            "   They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beattys sight, Montag felt the guilt of his hands. His fingers were like ferrets that had done some evil and now never rested, always stirred and picked and hid in pockets, moving from under Beattys alcohol-flame stare. If Beatty so much as breathed on them, Montag felt that his hands might wither, turn over on their sides, and never be shocked to life again; they would be buried the rest of his life in his coat-sleeves, forgotten. For these were the hands that had acted on their own, no part of him, here was where the conscience first manifested itself to snatch books, dart off with job and Ruth and Willie Shakespeare, and now, in the firehouse, these hands seemed gloved with blood.\n",
            "   Twice in half an hour, Montag had to rise from the game and go to the latrine to wash his hands. When he came back he hid his hands under the table.\n",
            "   Beatty laughed. “Lets have your hands in sight, Montag.\n",
            "   Not that we dont trust you, understand, but—”\n",
            "   They all laughed.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “the crisis is past and all is well, the sheep returns to the fold. Were all sheep who have strayed at times. Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning, weve cried. They are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts, weve shouted to ourselves. ‘Sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge,’ Sir Philip Sidney said. But on the other hand: ‘Words are like leaves and where they most abound, Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.’ Alexander Pope. What do you think of that?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.”\n",
            "   “Careful,” whispered Faber, living in another world, far away.\n",
            "   “Or this? ‘A little learning is a dangerous thing. Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring; There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again.’ Pope. Same Essay. Where does that put you?”\n",
            "   Montag bit his lip.\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” said Beatty, smiling at his cards. “That made you for a little while a drunkard. Read a few lines and off you go over the cliff. Bang, youre ready to blow up the world, chop off heads, knock down women and children, destroy authority. I know, Ive been through it all.”\n",
            "   “Im all right,” said Montag, nervously.\n",
            "   “Stop blushing. Im not needling, really Im not. Do you know, I had a dream an hour ago. I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said ‘Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!’ And I said, ‘Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that “He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.’” Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!”\n",
            "   “Dont listen,” whispered Faber. “Hes trying to confuse. Hes slippery. Watch out!”\n",
            "   Beatty chuckled. “And you said, quoting, ‘Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!’ And I cried in good humour, ‘Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!’ And ‘The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.’ And you yelled, ‘This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than of a threadbare saint in wisdoms school!’ And I whispered gently, ‘The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.’ And you screamed, ‘Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!’ And I said, patting your hand, ‘What, do I give you trench mouth?’ And you shrieked, ‘Knowledge is power!’ and ‘A dwarf on a giants shoulders of the furthest of the two!’ and I summed my side up with rare serenity in, ‘The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr. Valery once said.’”\n",
            "   Montags head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, “No! shut up, youre confusing things, stop it!” Beattys graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist.\n",
            "   “God, what a pulse! Ive got you going, have I, Montag. Jesus God, your pulse sounds like the day after the war. Everything but sirens and bells! Shall I talk some more? I like your look of panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I speak them all. A kind of excellent dumb discourse, Willie!”\n",
            "   “Montag, hold on!” The moth brushed Montags ear. “Hes muddying the waters!”\n",
            "   “Oh, you were scared silly,” said Beatty, “for I was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You think theyre backing you up, and they turn on you. Others can use them, too, and there you are, lost in the middle of the moor, in a great welter of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the very end of my dream, along I came with the Salamander and said, Going my way? And you got in and we drove back to the firehouse in beatific silence, all -dwindled away to peace.” Beatty let Montags wrist go, let the hand slump limply on the table. “Alls well that is well in the end.”\n",
            "   Silence. Montag sat like a carved white stone. The echo of the final hammer on his skull died slowly away into the black cavern where Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And then when the startled dust had settled down about Montags mind, Faber began, softly, “All right, hes had his say. You must take it in. Ill say my say, too, in the  few hours. And youll take it in. And youll try to judge them and make your decision as to which way to jump, or fall. But I want it to be your decision, not mine, and not the Captains. But remember that the Captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority. We all have our harps to play. And its up to you now to know with which ear youll listen.”\n",
            "   Montag opened his mouth to answer Faber and was saved this error in the presence of others when the station bell rang. The alarm-voice in the ceiling chanted. There was a tacking-tacking sound as the alarm-report telephone typed out the address across the room. Captain Beatty, his poker cards in one pink hand, walked with exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the address when the report was finished. He glanced perfunctorily at it, and shoved it in his pocket. He came back and sat down. The others looked at him.\n",
            "   “It can wait exactly forty seconds while I take all the money away from you,” said Beatty, happily.\n",
            "   Montag put his cards down.\n",
            "   “Tired, Montag? Going out of this game?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “Hold on. Well, come to think of it, we can finish this hand later. Just leave your cards face down and hustle the equipment. On the double now.” And Beatty rose up again. “Montag, you dont look well? Id hate to think you were coming down with another fever...”\n",
            "   “Ill be all right.”\n",
            "   “Youll be fine. This is a special case. Come on, jump for it!”\n",
            "   They leaped into the air and clutched the brass pole as if it were the last vantage point above a tidal wave passing below, and then the brass pole, to their dismay slid them down into darkness, into the blast and cough and suction of the gaseous dragon roaring to life!\n",
            "   “Hey!”\n",
            "   They rounded a corner in thunder and siren, with concussion of tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank, like the food in the stomach of a giant; with Montags fingers jolting off the silver rail, swinging into cold space, with the wind tearing his hair back from his head, with the wind whistling in his teeth, and him all the while thinking of the women, the chaff women in his parlour tonight, with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and his silly damned reading of a book to them. How like trying to put out fires with water-pistols, how senseless and insane. One rage turned in for another. One anger displacing another. When would he stop being entirely mad and be quiet, be very quiet indeed?\n",
            "   “Here we go!”\n",
            "   Montag looked up. Beatty never drove, but he was driving tonight, slamming the Salamander around corners, leaning forward high on the drivers throne, his massive black slicker flapping out behind so that he seemed a great black bat flying above the engine, over the brass numbers, taking the full wind.\n",
            "   “Here we go to keep the world happy, Montag!”\n",
            "   Beattys pink, phosphorescent cheeks glimmered in the high darkness, and he was smiling furiously.\n",
            "   “Here we are!”\n",
            "   The Salamander boomed to a halt, throwing men off in slips and clumsy hops. Montag stood fixing his raw eyes to the cold bright rail under his clenched fingers.\n",
            "   I cant do it, he thought. How can I go at this new assignment, how can I go on burning things? I cant go in this place.\n",
            "   Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had rushed, was at Montags elbow. “All right, Montag?”\n",
            "   The men ran like cripples in their clumsy boots, as quietly as spiders.\n",
            "   At last Montag raised his eyes and turned. Beatty was watching his face.\n",
            "   “Something the matter, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Why,” said Montag slowly, “weve stopped in front of my house.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   \n",
            "PART III\n",
            "BURNING BRIGHT\n",
            "\n",
            "   LIGHTS flicked on and house-doors opened all down the street, to watch the carnival set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with dry satisfaction, the other with disbelief, at the house before them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten.\n",
            "   “Well,” said Beatty, “now you did it. Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that hes burnt his damn wings, he wonders why. Didnt I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?”\n",
            "   Montags face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place  door, set in its bright borders of flowers.\n",
            "   Beatty snorted. “Oh, no! You werent fooled by that little idiots routine, now, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! Its all in her file. Ill be damned. Ive hit the bullseye. Look at the sick look on your face. A few grass-blades and the quarters of the moon. What trash. What good did she ever do with all that?”\n",
            "   Montag sat on the cold fender of the Dragon, moving his head half an inch to the left, half an inch to the right, left, right, left right, left...\n",
            "   “She saw everything. She didnt do anything to anyone. She just let them alone.”\n",
            "   “Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didnt she? One of those damn do-gooders with their shocked, holier-than-thou silences, their one talent making others feel guilty. God damn, they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed!”\n",
            "   The front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, running, one suitcase held with a dream-like clenching rigidity in her fist, as a beetle-taxi hissed to the curb.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick.\n",
            "   “Mildred, you didnt put in the alarm!”\n",
            "   She shoved the valise in the waiting beetle, climbed in, and sat mumbling, “Poor family, poor family, oh everything gone, everything, everything gone now...”\n",
            "   Beatty grabbed Montags shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour, far down the street, gone.\n",
            "   There was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms. Montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him, to see Stoneman and Black wielding axes, shattering window-panes to provide cross-ventilation.\n",
            "   The brush of a deaths-head moth against a cold black screen. “Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What is happening\n",
            "   “This is happening to me,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “What a dreadful surprise,” said Beatty. “For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are. But lets not talk about them, eh? By the time the consequences catch up with you, its too late, isnt it, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Montag, can you get away, run?” asked Faber.\n",
            "   Montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses. Beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze.\n",
            "   “What is there about fire thats so lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” Beatty blew out the flame and lit it again. “Its perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or almost perpetual motion. If you let it go on, itd burn our lifetimes out. What is fire? Its a mystery. Scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules. But they dont really know. Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets too burdensome, then into the furnace with it. Now, Montag, youre a burden. And fire will lift you off my shoulders, clean, quick, sure; nothing to rot later. Antibiotic, aesthetic, practical.”\n",
            "   Montag stood looking in now at this queer house, made strange by the hour of the night, by murmuring neighbour voices, by littered glass, and there on the floor, their covers torn off and spilled out like swan-feathers, the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth bothering with, for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper, and ravelled binding.\n",
            "   Mildred, of course. She must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them back in. Mildred. Mildred.\n",
            "   “I want you to do this job all by your lonesome, Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your house, your clean-up.”\n",
            "   “Montag, cant you run, get away!”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Montag helplessly. “The Hound! Because of the Hound!”\n",
            "   Faber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was meant for him, heard. “Yes, the Hounds somewhere about the neighbourhood, so dont try anything. Ready?”\n",
            "   “Ready.” Montag snapped the safety-catch on the flamethrower.\n",
            "   “Fire!”\n",
            "   A great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall. He stepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering whisper, with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain. He burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything, the chairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the silverware and plastic dishes, everything that showed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him tomorrow, who had gone and quite forgotten him already, listening to her Seashell radio pour in on her and in on her as she rode across town, alone. And as before, it was good to burn, he felt himself gush out in the fire, snatch, rend, rip in half with flame, and put away the senseless problem. If there was no solution, well then now there was no problem, either. Fire was best for everything!\n",
            "   “The books, Montag!”\n",
            "   The books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers.\n",
            "   And then he came to the parlour where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white thoughts and their snowy dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the vacuum hissed out at him. The emptiness made an even emptier whistle, a senseless scream. He tried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed, but he could not. He held his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs. He cut off its terrible emptiness, drew back, and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning. The fire-proof plastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame.\n",
            "   “When youre quite finished,” said Beatty behind him. “Youre under arrest.”\n",
            "   The house fell in red coals and black ash. It bedded itself down in sleepy pink-grey cinders and a smoke plume blew over it, rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky. It was three-thirty in the morning. The crowd drew back into the houses; the great tents of the circus had slumped into charcoal and rubble and the show was well over.\n",
            "   Montag stood with the flame-thrower in his limp hands, great islands of perspiration drenching his armpits, his face smeared with soot. The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces illuminated faintly by the smouldering foundation.\n",
            "   Montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together.\n",
            "   “Was it my wife turned in the alarm?”\n",
            "   Beatty nodded. “But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I let ride. One way or the other, youd have got it. It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly damn snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks hes the Lord of all Creation. You think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger, youll drown!”\n",
            "   Montag could not move. A great earthquake had come with fire and levelled the house and Mildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move. The earthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there, his knees half-bent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage, letting Beatty hit him without raising a hand.\n",
            "   “Montag, you idiot, Montag, you damn fool; why did you really do it?”\n",
            "   Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was running with his mind, he was gone, leaving this dead soot-covered body to sway in front of another raving fool.\n",
            "   “Montag, get out of there!” said Faber.\n",
            "   Montag listened.\n",
            "   Beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back. The green bullet in which Fabers voice whispered and cried, fell to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He held it half in, half out of his ear.\n",
            "   Montag heard the distant voice calling, “Montag, you all right?”\n",
            "   Beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket. “Well—so theres more here than I thought. I saw you tilt your head, listening. First I thought you had a Seashell. But when you turned clever later, I wondered. Well trace this and drop it on your friend.”\n",
            "   “No!” said Montag.\n",
            "   He twitched the safety catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montags fingers and his eyes widened the faintest bit. Montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his hands to see what new thing they had done. Thinking back later he could never decide whether the hands or Beattys reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder. The last rolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears, not touching him.\n",
            "   Beatty grinned his most charming grin. “Well, thats one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. Whatll it be this time? Why dont you belch Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? ‘There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind, which I respect not!’ Hows that? Go ahead now, you second-hand litterateur, pull the trigger.” He took one step toward Montag.\n",
            "   Montag only said, “We never burned right...”\n",
            "   “Hand it over, Guy,” said Beatty with a fixed smile.\n",
            "   And then he was a shrieking blaze, a jumping, sprawling, gibbering mannikin, no longer human or known, all writhing flame on the lawn as Montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on him. There was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove, a bubbling and frothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction and a boiling over of yellow foam. Montag shut his eyes, shouted, shouted, and fought to get his hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and at last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent.\n",
            "   The other two firemen did not move.\n",
            "   Montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flame-thrower. “Turn around!”\n",
            "   They turned, their faces like blanched meat, streaming sweat; he beat their heads, knocking off their helmets and bringing them down on themselves. They fell and lay without moving.\n",
            "   The blowing of a single autumn leaf.\n",
            "   He turned and the Mechanical Hound was there.\n",
            "   It was half across the lawn, coming from the shadows, moving with such drifting ease that it was like a single solid cloud of black-grey smoke blown at him in silence.\n",
            "   It made a single last leap into the air, coming down at Montag from a good three feet over his head, its spidered legs reaching, the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth. Montag caught it with a bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten feet back against the bole of a tree, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it scrabble and seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the Hound up in the air, burst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour like a skyrocket fastened to the street. Montag lay watching the dead-alive thing fiddle the air and die. Even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now working through the flesh of his leg. He felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles an hour. He was afraid to\n",
            "   get up, afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all, with an anaesthetized leg. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness...\n",
            "   And now...?\n",
            "   The street empty, the house burnt like an ancient bit of stage-scenery, the other homes dark, the Hound here, Beatty there, the three other firemen another place, and the Salamander...? He gazed at the immense engine. That would have to go, too.\n",
            "   Well, he thought, lets see how badly off you are. On your feet now. Easy, easy... there.\n",
            "   He stood and he had only one leg. The other was like a chunk of burnt pine-log he was carrying along as a penance for some obscure sin. When he put his weight on it, a shower of silver needles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on, you, you cant stay here!\n",
            "   A few house-lights were going on again down the street, whether from the incidents just passed, or because of the abnormal silence following the fight, Montag did not know. He hobbled around the ruins, seizing at his bad leg when it lagged, talking and whimpering and shouting directions at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital. He heard a number of people crying out in the darkness and shouting. He reached the back yard and the alley. Beatty, he thought, youre not a problem now. You always said, dont face a problem, bum it. Well, now Ive done both. Good-bye, Captain.\n",
            "   And he stumbled along the alley in the dark.\n",
            "   A shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought, youre a fool, a damn fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful idiot, a damn idiot, and a fool, a damn fool; look at the mess and wheres the mop, look at the mess, and what do you do? Pride, damn it, and temper, and youve junked it all, at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself. But everything at once, but everything one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, everything. No excuse, though, no excuse. A fool, a damn fool, go give yourself up!\n",
            "   No, well save what we can, well do what there is left to do. If we have to burn, lets take a few more with us. Here!\n",
            "   He remembered the books and turned back. Just on the off chance.\n",
            "   He found a few books where he had left them, near the garden fence. Mildred, God bless her, had missed a few. Four books still lay hidden where he had put them. Voices were wailing in the night and flashbeams swirled about. Other Salamanders were roaring their engines far away, and police sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens.\n",
            "   Montag took the four remaining books and hopped, jolted, hopped his way down the alley and suddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there. Something inside had jerked him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay where he had fallen and sobbed, his legs folded, his face pressed blindly to the gravel.\n",
            "   Beatty wanted to die.\n",
            "   In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there, joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air. How strange, strange, to want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and staying alive, you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad, and then...\n",
            "   At a distance, running feet.\n",
            "   Montag sat up. Lets get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just cant sit! But he was still crying and that had to be finished. It was going away now. He hadnt wanted to kill anyone, not even Beatty. His flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He saw Beatty, a torch, not moving, fluttering out on the grass. He bit at his knuckles. Im sorry, Im sorry, oh God, sorry...\n",
            "   He tried to piece it all together, to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago before the sieve and the sand, Denhams Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and excursions, too much for a few short days, too much, indeed, for a lifetime.\n",
            "   Feet ran in the far end of the alley.\n",
            "   “Get up!” he told himself. “Damn it, get up!” he said to the leg, and stood. The pains were spikes driven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common, ordinary safety pins, and after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps, filling his hand with slivers from the board fence, the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg. And the leg was at last his own leg again. He had been afraid that running might break the loose ankle. Now, sucking all the night into his open mouth, and blowing it out pale, with all the blackness left heavily inside himself, he set out in a steady jogging pace. He carried the books in his hands.\n",
            "   He thought of Faber.\n",
            "   Faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now. He had burnt Faber, too. He felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt Faber was really dead, baked like a roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.\n",
            "   You must remember, burn them or theyll burn you, he thought. Right now its as simple as that.\n",
            "   He searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other pocket he found the usual Seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning.\n",
            "   “Police Alert. Wanted: Fugitive in city. Has committed murder and crimes against the State. Name: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. Last seen...”\n",
            "   He ran steadily for six blocks, in the alley, and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty thoroughfare ten lanes wide. It seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open. It was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him to run across, easily seen in the blazing illumination, easily caught, easily shot down.\n",
            "   The Seashell hummed in his ear.\n",
            "   “...watch for a man running...watch for the running man... watch for a man alone, on foot... watch...”\n",
            "   Montag pulled back into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas station, a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there, and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up. Now he must be clean and presentable if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly across that wide boulevard. It would give him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to get where...?\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, where am I running?\n",
            "   Nowhere. There was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really. Except Faber. And then he realized that he was indeed, running toward Fabers house, instinctively. But Faber couldnt hide him; it would be suicide even to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway, for a few short minutes. Fabers would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in his own ability to survive. He just wanted to know that there was a man like Faber in the world. He wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body. And some of the money must be left with Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on his way. Perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the highways, in the fields and hills.\n",
            "   A great whirling whisper made him look to the sky.\n",
            "   The police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head off a dry dandelion flower. Two dozen of them flurried, wavering, indecisive, three miles off, like butterflies puzzled by autumn, and then they were plummeting down to land, one by one, here, there, softly kneading the streets where, turned back to beetles, they shrieked along the boulevards or, as suddenly, leapt back into the sir, continuing their search.\n",
            "   And here was the gas station, its attendants busy now with customers. Approaching from the rear, Montag entered the mens washroom. Through the aluminium wall he heard a radio voice saying, “War has been declared.” The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines, the gas, the money owed. Montag stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing would happen. The war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file, an hour, two hours from now.\n",
            "   He washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry, making little sound. He came out of the washroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the edge of the empty boulevard.\n",
            "   There it lay, a game for him to win, a vast bowling alley in the cool morning. The boulevard was as clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims and certain unknown killers. The air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the warmth of Montags body alone; it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it. And now he must begin his little walk.\n",
            "   Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep breath. His lungs were like burning brooms in his chest. His mouth was sucked dry from running. His throat tasted of bloody iron and there was rusted steel in his feet.\n",
            "   What about those lights there? Once you started walking youd have to gauge how fast those beetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the other curb? It seemed like a hundred yards. Probably not a hundred, but figure for that anyway, figure that with him going very slowly, at a nice stroll, it might take as much as thirty seconds, forty seconds to walk all the way. The beetles? Once started, they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds. So, even if halfway across he started to run...?\n",
            "   He put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right. He walked on the empty avenue.\n",
            "   Even if the street were entirely empty, of course, you couldnt be sure of a safe crossing, for a car could appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had taken a dozen breaths.\n",
            "   He decided not to count his steps. He looked neither to left nor right. The light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot.\n",
            "   He listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right. Its movable headlights jerked back and forth suddenly, and caught at Montag.\n",
            "   Keep going.\n",
            "   Montag faltered, got a grip on the books, and forced himself not to freeze. Instinctively he took a few quick, running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again. He was now half across the street, but the roar from the beetles engines whined higher as it put on speed.\n",
            "   The police, of course. They see me. But slow now; slow, quiet, dont turn, dont look, dont seem concerned. Walk, thats it, walls, walk.\n",
            "   The beetle was rushing. The beetle was roaring. The beetle raised its speed. The beetle was whining. The beetle was in high thunder. The beetle came skimming. The beetle came in a single whistling trajectory, fired from an invisible rifle. It was up to 120 m. p. h. It was up to 130 at least. Montag clamped his jaws. The heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks, it seemed, and jittered his eye-lids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body.\n",
            "   He began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran. He put out his legs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and down and back. God! God! He dropped a book, broke pace, almost turned, changed his mind, plunged on, yelling in concrete emptiness, the beetle scuttling after its running food, two hundred, one hundred feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag gasping, flailing his hands, legs up down out, up down out, closer, closer, hooting, calling, his eyes burnt white now as his head jerked about to confront the flashing glare, now the beetle was swallowed in its own light, now it was nothing but a torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. Now-almost on top of him!\n",
            "   He stumbled and fell.\n",
            "   Im done! Its over!\n",
            "   But the falling made a difference. An instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and swerved out. It was gone. Montag lay flat, his head down. Wisps of laughter trailed back to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle.\n",
            "   His right hand was extended above him, flat. Across the extreme tip of his middle finger, he saw now as he lifted that hand, a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tyre had touched in passing. He looked at that black line with disbelief, getting to his feet.\n",
            "   That wasnt the police, he thought.\n",
            "   He looked down the boulevard. It was clear now. A carful of children, all ages, God knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling, yelling, hurrahing, had seen a man, a very extraordinary sight, a man strolling, a rarity, and simply said, “Lets get him,” not knowing he was the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a,number of children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours, their faces icy with wind, and coming home or not coming at dawn, alive or not alive, that made the adventure.\n",
            "   They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek. For no reason at all in the world they would have killed me.\n",
            "   He walked toward the far kerb telling each foot to go and keep going. Somehow he had picked up the spilled books; he didnt remember bending or touching them. He kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse?\n",
            "   He stopped and his mind said it again, very loud.\n",
            "   I wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse!\n",
            "   He wanted to run after them yelling.\n",
            "   His eyes watered.\n",
            "   The thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that car, seeing Montag down, instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out. If Montag had remained an upright target...?\n",
            "   Montag gasped.\n",
            "   Far down the boulevard, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and was now racing back, slanting over on the wrong side of the street, picking up speed.\n",
            "   But Montag was gone, hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long journey, an hour or was it a minute, ago? He stood shivering in the night, looking back out as the beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue, whirling laughter in the air all about it, gone.\n",
            "   Further on, as Montag moved in darkness, he could see the helicopters falling, falling, like the first flakes of snow in the long winter. to come...\n",
            "   The house was silent.\n",
            "   Montag approached from the rear, creeping through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass. He touched the screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved across the porch, listening.\n",
            "   Mrs. Black, are you asleep in there? he thought. This isnt good, but your husband did it to others and never asked and never wondered and never worried. And now since youre a firemans wife, its your house and your turn, for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt without thinking..\n",
            "   The house did not reply.\n",
            "   He hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back and the house was still dark and quiet, sleeping.\n",
            "   On his way across town, with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky, he phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night. Then he stood in the cold night air, waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders coming, coming to bum Mr. Blacks house while he was away at work, to make his wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire. But now, she was still asleep.\n",
            "   Good night, Mrs. Black, he thought.—\n",
            "   “Faber!”\n",
            "   Another rap, a whisper, and a long waiting. Then, after a minute, a small light flickered inside Fabers small house. After another pause, the back door opened.\n",
            "   They stood looking at each other in the half-light, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in the others existence. Then Faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed Montag and moved him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were wailing off in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door.\n",
            "   Montag said, “Ive been a fool all down the line. I cant stay long. Im on my way God knows where.”\n",
            "   “At least you were a fool about the right things,” said Faber. “I thought you were dead. The audio-capsule I gave you—”\n",
            "   “Burnt.”\n",
            "   “I heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing. I almost came out looking for you.”\n",
            "   “The captains dead. He found the audio-capsule, he heard your voice, he was going to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower.”\n",
            "   Faber sat down and did not speak for a time.\n",
            "   “My God, how did this happen?” said Montag. “It was only the other night everything was fine and the  thing I know Im drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I cant breathe. Theres Beatty dead, and he was my friend once, and theres Millie gone, I thought she was my wife, but now I dont know. And the house all burnt. And my job gone and myself on the run, and I planted a book in a firemans house on the way. Good Christ, the things Ive done in a single week!”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. It was coming on for a long time.”\n",
            "   “Yes, I believe that, if theres nothing else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could feel it for a long time, I was saving something up, I went around doing one thing and feeling another. God, it was all there. Its a wonder it didnt show on me, like fat. And now here I am, messing up your life. They might follow me here.”\n",
            "   “I feel alive for the first time in years,” said Faber. “I feel Im doing what I should have done a lifetime ago. For a little while Im not afraid. Maybe its because Im doing the right thing at last. Maybe its because Ive done a rash thing and dont want to look the coward to you. I suppose Ill have to do even more violent things, exposing myself so I wont fall down on the job and turn scared again. What are your plans?”\n",
            "   “To keep running.”\n",
            "   “You know the wars on?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   “God, isnt it funny?” said the old man. “It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.”\n",
            "   “I havent had time to think.” Montag drew out a hundred dollars. “I want this to stay with you, use it any way thatll help when Im gone.”\n",
            "   “But—”\n",
            "   “I might be dead by noon; use this.”\n",
            "   Faber nodded. “Youd better head for the river if you can, follow along it, and if you can hit the old railroad lines going out into the country, follow them. Even though practically everythings airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the rails are still there, rusting. Ive heard there are still hobo camps all across the country, here and there; walking camps they call them, and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled, they say theres lots of old Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are wanted and hunted in the cities. They survive, I guess. There arent many of them, and I guess the Governments never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down. You might hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in St. Louis, Im leaving on the five a. m. bus this morning, to see a retired printer there, Im getting out into the open myself, at last. The money will be put to good use. Thanks and God bless you. Do you want to sleep a few minutes?”\n",
            "   “Id better run.”\n",
            "   “Lets check.”\n",
            "   He took Montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside, revealing a television screen the size of a postal card. “I always wanted something very small, something I could talk to, something I could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary, nothing that could shout me down, nothing monstrous big. So, you see.” He snapped it on. “Montag,” the TV set said, and lit up. “M-O-N-T-A-G.” The name was spelled out by the voice. “Guy Montag. Still running. Police helicopters are up. A new Mechanical Hound has been brought from another district...”\n",
            "   Montag and Faber looked at each other.\n",
            "   “...Mechanical Hound never fails. Never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible invention made a mistake. Tonight, this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the Hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target...”\n",
            "   Faber poured two glasses of whisky. “Well need these.”\n",
            "   They drank.\n",
            "   “...nose so sensitive the Mechanical Hound can remember and identify ten thousand odour-indexes on ten thousand men without re-setting!”\n",
            "   Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house, at the walls, the door, the doorknob, and the chair where Montag now sat. Montag saw the look. They both looked quickly about the house and Montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the sweat of his hand hung from the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the jewels of a small chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about everything, he was a luminous cloud, a ghost that made breathing once more impossible. He saw Faber stop up his own breath for fear of drawing that ghost into his own body, perhaps, being contaminated with the phantom exhalations and odours of a running man.\n",
            "   “The Mechanical Hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the Burning!”\n",
            "   And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd, and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower.\n",
            "   So they must have their game out, thought Montag. The circus must go on, even with war beginning within the hour...\n",
            "   He watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed so remote and no part of him; it was a play apart and separate, wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. Thats all for me, you thought, thats all taking place just for me, by God.\n",
            "   If he wished, he could linger here, in comfort, and follow the entire hunt on through its swift. phases, down alleys across streets, over empty running avenues, crossing lots and playgrounds, with pauses here or there for the necessary commercials, up other alleys to the burning house of Mr. and Mrs. Black, and so on finally to this house with Faber and himself seated, drinking, while the Electric Hound snuffed down the last trail, silent as a drift of death itself, skidded to a halt outside that window there. Then, if he wished, Montag might rise, walk to the window, keep one eye on the TV screen, open the window, lean out, look back, and see himself dramatized, described, made over, standing there, limned in the bright small television screen from outside, a drama to be watched objectively, knowing that in other parlours he was large as life, in full colour, dimensionally perfect! And if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself, an instant before oblivion, being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlour-sitters who had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their living-room walls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man carnival.\n",
            "   Would he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty million people, mightnt he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would stay with them long after the. Hound had turned, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera remained stationary, watching the creature dwindle in the distance—a splendid fade-out! What could he say in a single word, a few words, that would sear all their faces and wake them up?\n",
            "   “There,” whispered Faber.\n",
            "   Out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine, not animal, not dead, not alive, glowing with a pale green luminosity. It stood near the smoking ruins of Montags house and the men brought his discarded flame-thrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the Hound. There was a whirring, clicking, humming.\n",
            "   Montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink. “Its time. Im sorry about this:”\n",
            "   “About what? Me? My house? I deserve everything. Run, for Gods sake. Perhaps I can delay them here—”\n",
            "   “Wait. Theres no use your being discovered. When I leave, burn the spread of this bed, that I touched. Burn the chair in the living room, in your wall incinerator. Wipe down the furniture with alcohol, wipe the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning on full in all the rooms and spray with moth-spray if you have it. Then, turn on your lawn sprinklers as high as theyll go and hose off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the trail in here, anyway..\n",
            "   Faber shook his hand. “Ill tend to it. Good luck. If were both in good health,  week, the week after, get in touch. General Delivery, St. Louis. Im sorry theres no way I can go with you this time, by ear-phone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I never thought I would use it. What a silly old man. No thought there. Stupid, stupid. So I havent another green bullet, the right kind, to put in your head. Go now!”\n",
            "   “One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, some old sneakers and socks...”\n",
            "   Faber was gone and back in a minute. They sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape. “To keep the ancient odour of Mr. Faber in, of course,” said Faber sweating at the job.\n",
            "   Montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky. “I dont want that Hound picking up two odours at once. May I take this whisky. Ill need it later. Christ I hope this works!”\n",
            "   They shook hands again and, going out of the door, they glanced at the TV. The Hound was on its way, followed by hovering helicopter cameras, silently, silently, sniffing the great night wind. It was running down the first alley.\n",
            "   “Good-bye!”\n",
            "   And Montag was out the back door lightly, running with the half-empty valise. Behind him he heard the lawn-sprinkling system jump up, filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then with a steady pour all about, washing on the sidewalks, and draining into the alley. He carried a few drops of this rain with him on his face. He thought he heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasnt certain.\n",
            "   He ran very fast away from the house, down toward the river.\n",
            "   Montag ran.\n",
            "   He could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and swift, like a wind that didnt stir grass, that didnt jar windows or disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Hound did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it, so you could feel the silence building up a pressure behind you all across town. Montag felt the pressure rising, and ran.\n",
            "   He stopped for breath, on his way to the river, to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened houses, and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlour walls and there on the walls the Mechanical Hound, a breath of neon vapour, spidered along, here and gone, here and gone! Now at Elm Terrace, Lincoln, Oak, Park, and up the alley toward Fabers house.\n",
            "   Go past, thought Montag, dont stop, go on, dont turn in!\n",
            "   On the parlour wall, Fabers house, with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air.\n",
            "   The Hound paused, quivering.\n",
            "   No! Montag held to the window sill. This way! Here!\n",
            "   The procaine needle flicked out and in, out and in. A single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell from the needle as it vanished in the Hounds muzzle.\n",
            "   Montag held his breath, like a doubled fist, in his chest.\n",
            "   The Mechanical Hound turned and plunged away from Fabers house down the alley again.\n",
            "   Montag snapped his gaze to the sky. The helicopters were closer, a great blowing of insects to a single light source.\n",
            "   With an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.\n",
            "   He shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window, and the fascinating seance going on in there! Hell! and he was away and gone! The alley, a street, the alley, a street, and the smell of the river. Leg out, leg down, leg out and down. Twenty million Montags running, soon, if the cameras caught him. Twenty million Montags running, running like an ancient flickery Keystone Comedy, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had seen it a thousand times. Behind him now twenty million silently baying Hounds ricocheted across parlours, three-cushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall, gone, right wall, centre wall, left wall, gone!\n",
            "   Montag jammed his Seashell to his ear.\n",
            "   “Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the  minute looks from his house. Ready!”\n",
            "   Of course! Why hadnt they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadnt this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldnt be missed! The only man running alone in the night city, the only man proving his legs!\n",
            "   “At the count of ten now! One! Two!”\n",
            "   He felt the city rise. Three .\n",
            "   He felt the city turn to its thousands of doors.\n",
            "   Faster! Leg up, leg down!\n",
            "   “Four!”\n",
            "   The people sleepwalking in their hallways.\n",
            "   “Five!”\n",
            "   He felt their hands on the doorknobs!\n",
            "   The smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain. His throat was burnt rust and his eyes were wept dry with running. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last hundred yards.\n",
            "   “Six, seven, eight!”\n",
            "   The doorknobs turned on five thousand doors. “Nine!”\n",
            "   He ran out away from the last row of houses, on a slope leading down to a solid moving blackness. “Ten!”\n",
            "   The doors opened.\n",
            "   He imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards, into alleys, and into the sky, faces hid by curtains, pale, night-frightened faces, like grey animals peering from electric caves, faces with grey colourless eyes, grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb flesh of the face.\n",
            "   But he was at the river.\n",
            "   He touched it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin, splashed his body, arms, legs, and head with raw liquor; drank it and snuffed some up his nose. Then he dressed in Fabers old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river and watched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the dark.\n",
            "   He was three hundred yards downstream when the Hound reached the river. Overhead the great racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light fell upon the river and Montag dived under the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds. He felt the river pull him further on its way, into darkness. Then the lights switched back to the land, the helicopters swerved over the city again, as if they had picked up another trail. They were gone. The Hound was gone. Now there was only the cold river and Montag floating in a sudden peacefulness, away from the city and the lights and the chase, away from everything.\n",
            "   He felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors. He felt as if he had left the great seance and all the murmuring ghosts. He was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a reality that was unreal because it was new.\n",
            "   The black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.\n",
            "   He floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper. The river was very real; it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last, the leisure, to consider this month, this year, and a lifetime of years. He listened to his heart slow. His thoughts stopped rushing with his blood.\n",
            "   He saw the moon low in the sky now. The moon there, and the light of the moon caused by what? By the sun, of course. And what lights the sun? Its own fire. And the sun goes on, day after day, burning and burning. The sun and time. The sun and time and burning. Burning. The river bobbled him along gently. Burning. The sun and every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a single thing in his mind. After a long time of floating on the land and a short time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life.\n",
            "   The sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant. that everything burned!\n",
            "   One of them had to stop burning. The sun wouldnt, certainly. So it looked as if it had to be Montag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago. Somewhere the saving and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one way or another, in books, in records, in peoples heads, any way at all so long as it was safe, free from moths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and men with matches. The world was full of burning of all types and sizes. Now the guild of the asbestos-weaver must open shop very soon.\n",
            "   He felt his heel bump land, touch pebbles and rocks, scrape sand. The river had moved him toward shore.\n",
            "   He looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light, without shape, with only a size that went a thousand miles without wanting to stop, with its grass hills and forests that were waiting for him.\n",
            "   He hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water. He expected the Hound there. Suddenly the trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters.\n",
            "   But there was only the normal autumn wind high up, going by like another river. Why wasnt the Hound running? Why had the search veered inland? Montag listened. Nothing. Nothing.\n",
            "   Millie, he thought. All this country here. Listen to it! Nothing and nothing. So much silence, Millie, I wonder how youd take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad.\n",
            "   Millie was not here and the Hound was not here, but the dry smell of hay blowing from some distant field put Montag on the land. He remembered a farm he had visited when he was very young, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of unreality, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the tin moat of the city, cows chewed grass and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill.\n",
            "   Now, the dry smell of hay, the motion of the waters, made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a lonely barn away from the loud highways, behind a quiet farmhouse, and under an ancient windmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead. He lay in the high barn loft all night, listening to distant animals and insects and trees, the little motions and stirrings.\n",
            "   During the night, he thought, below the loft, he would hear a sound like feet moving, perhaps. He would tense and sit up. The sound would move away, He would lie back and look out of the loft window, very late in the night, and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself, until a very young and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to see her, but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now, so very long ago, the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin. Then, she would be gone from the warm window and appear again upstairs in her moon-whitened room. And then, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon, he would lie in the loft, hidden and safe, watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth, fleeing from the soft colour of dawn.\n",
            "   In the morning he would not have needed sleep, for all the warm odours and sights of a complete country night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth, when he thought to test it, was half a smile.\n",
            "   And there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, waiting for him, would be the incredible thing. He would step carefully down, in the pink light of early morning, so fully aware of the world that he would be afraid, and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it.\n",
            "   A cool glass of fresh milk, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps.\n",
            "   This was all he wanted now. Some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him the long time needed to think all the things that must be thought.\n",
            "   A glass of milk, an apple, a pear.\n",
            "   He stepped from the river.\n",
            "   The land rushed at him, a tidal wave. He was crushed by darkness and the look of the country and the million odours on a wind that iced his body. He fell back under the breaking curve of darkness and sound and smell, his ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over his sight like flaming meteors. He wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down somewhere. This dark land rising was like that day in his childhood, swimming, when from nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and green darkness, water burning mouth and nose, retching his stomach, screaming! Too much water!\n",
            "   Too much land!\n",
            "   Out of the black wall before him, a whisper. A shape. In the shape, two eyes. The night looking at him. The forest, seeing him.\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   After all the running and rushing and sweating it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work this hard, and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find...\n",
            "   The Hound!\n",
            "   Montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man.\n",
            "   The shape exploded away. The eyes vanished. The leafpiles flew up in a dry shower.\n",
            "   Montag was alone in the wilderness.\n",
            "   A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-like perfume mingled with blood and the gummed exhalation of the animals breath, all cardamon and moss and ragweed odour in this huge night where the trees ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the pulse of the heart behind his eyes.\n",
            "   There must have been a billion leaves on the land; he waded in them, a dry river smelling of hot cloves and warm dust. And the other smells! There was a smell like a cut potato from all the land, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. There was a smell like pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home. There was a faint yellow odour like mustard from a jar. There was a smell like carnations from the yard  door. He put down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him. His fingers smelled of liquorice.\n",
            "   He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was filled up with all the details of the land. He was not empty. There was more than enough here to fill him. There would always be more than enough.\n",
            "   He walked in the shallow tide of leaves, stumbling.\n",
            "   And in the middle of the strangeness, a familiarity.\n",
            "   His foot hit something that rang dully.\n",
            "   He moved his hand on the ground, a yard this way, a yard that.\n",
            "   The railroad track.\n",
            "   The track that came out of the city and rusted across the land, through forests and woods, deserted now, by the river.\n",
            "   Here was the path to wherever he was going. Here was the single familiar thing, the magic charm he might need a little while, to touch, to feel beneath his feet, as he moved on into the bramble bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the blowing down of leaves.\n",
            "   He walked on the track.\n",
            "   And he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove.\n",
            "   Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking now.\n",
            "   Half an hour later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware of his entire body, his face, his mouth, his eyes stuffed with blackness, his ears stuffed with sound, his legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he saw the fire ahead.\n",
            "   The fire was gone, then back again, like a winking eye. He stopped, afraid he might blow the fire out with a single breath. But the fire was there and he approached warily, from a long way off. It took the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it, and then he stood looking at it from cover. That small motion, the white and red colour, a strange fire because it meant a different thing to him.\n",
            "   It was not burning; it was warming!\n",
            "   He saw many hands held to its warmth, hands without arms, hidden in darkness. Above the hands, motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight. He hadnt known fire could look this way. He had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take. Even its smell was different.\n",
            "   How long he stood he did not know, but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing himself as an animal come from the forest, drawn by the fire. He was a thing of brush and liquid eye, of fur and muzzle and hoof, he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long long time, listening to the warm crackle of the flames.\n",
            "   There was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the mens faces, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn it over with the eyes, as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of steel these men were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the silence. Montag moved toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world.\n",
            "   And then the voices began and they were talking, and he could hear nothing of what the voices said, but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking at it; the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river. The voices talked of everything, there was nothing they could not talk about, he knew from the very cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them.\n",
            "   And then one of the men looked up and saw him, for the first or perhaps the seventh time, and a voice called to Montag:\n",
            "   “All right, you can come out now!”\n",
            "   Montag stepped back into the shadows.\n",
            "   “Its all right,” the voice said. “Youre welcome here.”\n",
            "   Montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits. He did not know what to say to them.\n",
            "   “Sit down,” said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group. “Have some coffee?”\n",
            "   He watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity. His lips were scalded, but that was good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat, and their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down again. Montag sipped. “Thanks,” he said. “Thanks very much.”\n",
            "   “Youre welcome, Montag. My names Granger.” He held out a small bottle of colourless fluid. “Drink this, too. Itll change the chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now youll smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the best thing is Bottoms up.”\n",
            "   Montag drank the bitter fluid.\n",
            "   “Youll stink like a bobcat, but thats all right,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “You know my name;” said Montag.\n",
            "   Granger nodded to a portable battery TV set by the fire.\n",
            "   “Weve watched the chase. Figured youd wind up south along the river. When we heard you plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk, we didnt hide as we usually do. We figured you were in the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city. Something funny there. The chase is still running. The other way, though.”\n",
            "   “The other way?”\n",
            "   “Lets have a look.”\n",
            "   Granger snapped the portable viewer on. The picture was a nightmare, condensed, easily passed from hand to hand, in the forest, all whirring colour and flight. A voice cried:\n",
            "   “The chase continues north in the city! Police helicopters are converging on Avenue 87 and Elm Grove Park!”\n",
            "   Granger nodded. “Theyre faking. You threw them off at the river. They cant admit it. They know they can hold their audience only so long. The shows got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So theyre sniffing for a scape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. Theyll catch Montag in the  five minutes!”\n",
            "   “But how—”\n",
            "   “Watch.”\n",
            "   The camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street.\n",
            "   “See that?” whispered Granger. “Itll be you; right up at the end of that street is our victim. See how our camera is coming in? Building the scene. Suspense. Long shot. Right now, some poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Dont think the police dont know the habits of queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia Anyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. Never know when that sort of information might be handy. And today, it turns out, its very usable indeed. It saves face. Oh, God, look there!”\n",
            "   The men at the fire bent forward.\n",
            "   On the screen, a man turned a corner. The Mechanical Hound rushed forward into the viewer, suddenly. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the man.\n",
            "   A voice cried, “Theres Montag! The search is done!”\n",
            "   The innocent man stood bewildered, a cigarette burning in his hand. He stared at the Hound, not knowing what it was. He probably never knew. He glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens. The cameras rushed down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victims face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target.\n",
            "   “Montag, dont move!” said a voice from the sky.\n",
            "   The camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him simultaneously. The victim was seized by Hound and camera in a great spidering, clenching grip. He screamed. He screamed. He screamed!\n",
            "   Blackout.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   Montag cried out in the silence and turned away.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   And then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces expressionless, an announcer on the dark screen said, “The search is over, Montag is dead; a crime against society has been avenged.”\n",
            "   Darkness.\n",
            "   “We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a half-hour of Just-Before-Dawn, a programme of-”\n",
            "   Granger turned it off.\n",
            "   “They didnt show the mans face in focus. Did you notice?\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Even your best friends couldnt tell if it was you. They scrambled it just enough to let the imagination take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.”\n",
            "   Montag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen, trembling.\n",
            "   Granger touched Montags arm. “Welcome back from the dead.” Montag nodded. Granger went on. “You might as well know all of us, now. This is Fred Clement, former occupant of the Thomas Hardy chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Engineering School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U. C. L. A., a specialist in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for ethics, an ancient study now, for Columbia University quite some years ago. Reverend Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one Sunday and the  for his views. Hes been bumming with us some time now. Myself: I wrote a book called The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and Society, and here I am! Welcome, Montag!”\n",
            "   “I dont belong with you,” said Montag, at last, slowly. “Ive been an idiot all the way.”\n",
            "   “Were used to that. We all made the right kind of mistakes, or we wouldnt be here. When we were separate individuals, all we had was rage. I struck a fireman when he came to burn my library years ago. Ive been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “What have you to offer?”\n",
            "   “Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Revelation, but I havent even that now.”\n",
            "   “The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. Where was it?”\n",
            "   “Here,” Montag touched his head.\n",
            "   “Ah,” Granger smiled and nodded.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong? Isnt that all right?” said Montag.\n",
            "   “Better than all right; perfect!” Granger turned to the Reverend. “Do we have a Book of Ecclesiastes?”\n",
            "   “One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.”\n",
            "   “Montag.” Granger took Montags shoulder firmly. “Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important youve become in the last minute!”\n",
            "   “But Ive forgotten!”\n",
            "   “No, nothings ever lost. We have ways to shake down your clinkers for you.”\n",
            "   “But Ive tried to remember!”\n",
            "   “Dont try. Itll come when we need it. All of us have photographic memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now weve got the method down to where we can recall anything thats been read once. Would you like, some day, Montag, to read Platos Republic?”\n",
            "   “Of course!”\n",
            "   “I am Platos Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons is Marcus.”\n",
            "   “How do you do?” said Mr. Simmons.\n",
            "   “Hello,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political book, Gullivers Travels! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and-this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and this one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.”\n",
            "   Everyone laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “It cant be,” said Montag.\n",
            "   “It is,” replied Granger, smiling.” Were book-burners, too. We read the books and burnt them, afraid theyd be found. Micro-filming didnt pay off; we were always travelling, we didnt want to bury the film and come back later. Always the chance of discovery. Better to keep it in the old heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and pieces of history and literature and international law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, its here. And the hour is late. And the wars begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a thousand colours. What do you think, Montag?”\n",
            "   “I think I was blind trying to do things my way, planting books in firemens houses and sending in alarms.”\n",
            "   “You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully. But our way is simpler and, we think, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need, intact and safe. Were not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are destroyed, the knowledge is dead, perhaps for good. We are model citizens, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the city people let us be. Were stopped and searched occasionally, but theres nothing on our persons to incriminate us. The organization is flexible, very loose, and fragmentary. Some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and fingerprints. Right now we have a horrible job; were waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end. Its not pleasant, but then were not in control, were the odd minority crying in the wilderness. When the wars over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world.”\n",
            "   “Do you really think theyll listen then?”\n",
            "   “If not, well just have to wait. Well pass the books on to our children, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course.\n",
            "   But you cant make people listen. They have to come round in their own time, wondering what happened and why the world blew up under them. It cant last.”\n",
            "   “How many of you are there?”\n",
            "   “Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, bums on the outside, libraries inside. It wasnt planned, at first. Each man had a book he wanted to remember, and did. Then, over a period of twenty years or so, we met each other, travelling, and got the loose network together and set out a plan. The most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not important, we mustnt be pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world. Were nothing more than dust-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise. Some of us live in small towns. Chapter One of Thoreaus Walden in Green River, Chapter Two in Willow Farm, Maine. Why, theres one town in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bombll ever touch that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And when the wars over, some day, some year, the books can be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what they know and well set it up in type until another Dark Age, when we might have to do the whole damn thing over again. But thats the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing.”\n",
            "   “What do we do tonight?” asked Montag.\n",
            "   “Wait,” said Granger. “And move downstream a little way, just in case.”\n",
            "   He began throwing dust and dirt on the fire.\n",
            "   The other men helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the wilderness, the men all moved their hands, putting out the fire together.\n",
            "   They stood by the river in the starlight.\n",
            "   Montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. Five. Five oclock in the morning. Another year ticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river.\n",
            "   “Why do you trust me?” said Montag.\n",
            "   A man moved in the darkness.\n",
            "   “The look of yous enough. You havent seen yourself in a mirror lately. Beyond that, the city has never cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses in their heads cant touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone knows it. So long as the vast population doesnt wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the Constitution, its all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities dont bother us. And you look like hell.”\n",
            "   They moved along the bank of the river, going south. Montag tried to see the mens faces, the old faces he remembered from the firelight, lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perhaps he had expected their faces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried, to glow as lanterns glow, with the light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these men had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race, searched a long search, seen good things destroyed, and now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the lamps. They werent at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every future dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the customers who might come by in later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers.\n",
            "   Montag squinted from one face to another as they walked.\n",
            "   “Dont judge a book by its cover,” someone said.\n",
            "   And they all laughed quietly, moving downstream.\n",
            "   There was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up. Montag stared back at the city, far down the river, only a faint glow now.\n",
            "   “My wifes back there.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry to hear that. The cities wont do well in the  few days,” said Granger.\n",
            "   “Its strange, I dont miss her, its strange I dont feel much of anything,” said Montag. “Even if she dies, I realized a moment ago, I dont think Ill feel sad. It isnt right. Something must be wrong with me.”\n",
            "   “Listen,” said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind man who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slum in our town; and he made toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his hands. And when he died, I suddenly realized I wasnt crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. Ive never gotten over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands. He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten million fine actions the night he passed on.”\n",
            "   Montag walked in silence. “Millie, Millie,” he whispered. “Millie.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I cant remember anything. I think of her hands but I dont see them doing anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or theres a cigarette in them, but thats all.”\n",
            "   Montag turned and glanced back.\n",
            "   What did you give to the city, Montag?\n",
            "   Ashes.\n",
            "   What did the others give to each other?\n",
            "   Nothingness.\n",
            "   Granger stood looking back with Montag. “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, youre there. It doesnt matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”\n",
            "   Granger moved his hand. “My grandfather showed me some V-2 rocket films once, fifty years ago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb mushroom from two hundred miles up? Its a pinprick, its nothing. With the wilderness all around it.\n",
            "   “My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people that were allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back what it has given, as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so big. When we forget how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be. You see?” Granger turned to Montag. “Grandfathers been dead for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by God, in the convolutions of my brain youd find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me. As I said earlier, he was a sculptor. ‘I hate a Roman named Status Quo!’ he said to me. ‘Stuff your eyes with wonder,’ he said, ‘live as if youd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. Its more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,’ he said, ‘shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.’”\n",
            "   “Look!” cried Montag.\n",
            "   And the war began and ended in that instant.\n",
            "   Later, the men around Montag could not say if they had really seen anything. Perhaps the merest flourish of light and motion in the sky. Perhaps the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles, one mile up, for the merest instant, like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand, and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning city they had left behind. The bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished, once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour; as quick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a full three seconds, all of the time in history, before the bombs struck, the enemy ships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander might not believe because they were invisible; yet the heart is suddenly shattered, the body falls in separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air; the brain squanders its few precious memories and, puzzled, dies.\n",
            "   This was not to be believed. It was merely a gesture. Montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist over the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, disintegrate, leave no stone on another, perish. Die.\n",
            "   Montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. “Run!” he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, “Run!” To Mildred, “Get out, get out of there!” But Clarisse, he remembered, was dead. And Faber was out; there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five a. m. bus was on its way from one desolation to another. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man could make it. Before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway, its destination would be meaningless, and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard.\n",
            "   And Mildred...\n",
            "   Get out, run!\n",
            "   He saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her building. He saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of colour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her, where the family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a half-inch, now a quarter-inch from the top of the hotel. Leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, nervously, as if to plunge, drop, fall into that swarming immensity of colour to drown in its bright happiness.\n",
            "   The first bomb struck.\n",
            "   “Mildred!”\n",
            "   Perhaps, who would ever know? Perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of colour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion.\n",
            "   Montag, falling flat, going down, saw or felt, or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in Millies face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own face reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of itself, that at last she recognized it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way.\n",
            "   I remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago. Chicago, a long time ago. Millie and I. Thats where we met! I remember now. Chicago. A long time ago.\n",
            "   The concussion knocked the air across and down the river, turned the men over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in lifting sprays, and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn with a great wind passing away south. Montag crushed himself down, squeezing himself small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant saw the city, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For another of those impossible instants the city stood, rebuilt and unrecognizable, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had built it, erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a reversed avalanche, a million colours, a million oddities, a door where a window should be, a top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell down dead.\n",
            "   Montag, lying there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth, gasping and crying, now thought again, I remember, I remember, I remember something else. What is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it, quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off, before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to himself silently, lying flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denhams Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Preacher by himself, standing there in his mind, looking at him...\n",
            "   “There,” said a voice.\n",
            "   The men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass. They held to the earth as children hold to familiar things, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from bursting, to keep their sanity from bursting, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed.\n",
            "   Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And lying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now. Silence fell down in the sifting dust, and all the leisure they might need to look around, to gather the reality of this day into their senses.\n",
            "   Montag looked at the river. Well go on the river. He looked at the old railroad tracks. Or well go that way. Or well walk on the highways now, and well have time to put things into ourselves. And some day, after it sets in us a long time, itll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a lot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. Well just start walking today and see the world and the way the world walks around and talks, the way it really looks. I want to see everything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a while itll all gather together inside and itll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where its finally me, where its in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I get hold of it so itll never run off. Ill hold on to the world tight some day. Ive got one finger on it now; thats a beginning.\n",
            "   The wind died.\n",
            "   The other men lay a while, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and begin the days obligations, its fires and foods, its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They lay blinking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then slow...\n",
            "   Montag sat up.\n",
            "   He did not move any further, however. The other men did likewise. The sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain.\n",
            "   Silently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the river to look upstream.\n",
            "   “Its flat,” he said, a long time later. “City looks like a heap of baking-powder. Its gone.” And a long time after that. “I wonder how many knew it was coming? I wonder how many were surprised?”\n",
            "   And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a thousand?\n",
            "   Someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet and sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly, with nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down.\n",
            "   Granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. “Well have a bite. Then well turn around and walk upstream. Theyll be needing us up that way.”\n",
            "   Someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it and the frying-pan was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this ritual silently.\n",
            "   Granger looked into the fire. “Phoenix.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ: every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like were doing the same thing, over and over, but weve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things weve done for a thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day well stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember, every generation.”\n",
            "   He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully.\n",
            "   “Now, lets get on upstream,” said Granger. “And hold on to one thought: Youre not important. Youre not anything. Some day the load were carrying with us may help someone. But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didnt use what we got out of them. We went right on insulting the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. Were going to meet a lot of lonely people in the  week and the  month and the  year. And when they ask us what were doing, you can say, Were remembering. Thats where well win out in the long run. And some day well remember so much that well build the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up. Come on now, were going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the  year and take a long look in them.”\n",
            "   They finished eating and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been given more wick. In the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down.\n",
            "   Montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him, going north. He was surprised, and moved aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of hay, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going until he caught up with the people.\n",
            "   But now there was a long mornings walk until noon, and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things they remembered, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them. Montag felt the slow stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else? Something, something...\n",
            "   And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n",
            "   Yes, thought Montag, thats the one Ill save for noon. For noon...\n",
            "   When we reach the city.\n",

            "   After all, my alienist, truly alien, had the coincidental name, Von Seyfertitz, of the tall, lean, aquiline, menacing, and therefore beautiful actor who played the high priest in the 1935 film She.\n",
            "   In She, the wondrous villain waved his skeleton fingers, hurled insults, summoned sulfured flames, destroyed slaves, and knocked the world into earthquakes.\n",

            "   As you can see, Gustav Von Seyfertitz was a most unusual mine specialist. Mine? Yes. Our problems are land mines in our heads. Step on them! Shock-troop therapy, he once called it, searching for words. “Blitzkrieg?” I offered.\n",

            "   Again, this was my third visit to his strange, metallic-looking room with a most odd series of locks on a roundish door. Suddenly, as I was maundering and treading dark waters, I heard his spine stiffen behind me.

            "   To see a submarine periscope, all polished brass, slide up to vanish in the ceiling.\n",
            "   Gustav Von Seyfertitz stood pretending not to notice me, the sweat-oiled leather couch, or the vanished brass machine. Very calmly, in the fashion of Conrad Veidt in Casablanca, or Erich Von\n",

            "   “Fire one,” he ordered.\n",
            "   I almost heard the torpedo leave its tube. “Fire two!” he said.\n",
            "   And a second soundless and invisible bomb\n",

            "   “Id rather not,” I said uneasily.\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye, raked at an angle, glared at me. It had an uncanny resemblance, in its glassy coldness, his own fierce hawks gaze.\n",
            "   His voice, from behind the periscope, echoed. “So you want to know, eh, how Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, suffered to leave the cold ocean depths, depart his dear North Sea ship, flee his destroyed and beaten fatherland, to become the Unterderseaboat Doktor—”\n",
            "   “Now that you mention—”\n",

            "   “Not just now...” I said uneasily.\n",
            "   His heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me: a bright, thin monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg. I winced. For now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with cold fire.\n",
            "   “Why the monocle?” I said.\n",
            "   “Idiot! It is to cover my good eye so that neither there eye can see and my intuition is free to work!”\n",
            "   “Oh,” I said.\n",
            "   And he began his monologue. And as he talked I realized his need had been pent up, capped, years, so he talked on and on, forgetting me.\n",
            "   And it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred. I rose slowly to my feet as Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz circled, his long, slim cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air, which read like white Rorschach blots.\n",
            "   With each implantation of his foot, a word ca out, and then another, in a sort of plodding grammar. Sometimes he stopped and stood poised with one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his tongue and examined. Then the shoe went down, the noun slid forth and the verb and object in good time.\n",
            "   Until at last, circling, I found myself in a chair stunned, for I saw:\n",
            "   Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz stretched on his couch, his long spider fingers laced on his chest.\n",
            "   “It has been no easy thing to come forth on land,” he sibilated. “Some days I was the jellyfish, frozen. Others, the shore-strewn octopi, at least with tentacles, or the crayfish sucked back into my skull. But I have built my spine, year on year, and now I walk among the land men and survive.”\n",
            "   He paused to take a trembling breath, then continued:\n",

I am not in the Amalgamated Fruitcake Cinema business. I only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails, cleaning earwax, and erasing inkblots from odd bean-bags like you. If I stop, I will fly apart. That periscope contains all and everything I have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans, cashews, and almonds.

There were Von Seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine periscope sold at the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. With the super inducement of a half-million dollars, he force-fed and easily sold a bad book.

            "   “See what you have done to me!” Von Seyfertitz pointed.\n",
            "   The office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling. The desk was from Napoleons age an exquisite Empire piece worth at least fifty thousand dollars. The couch was the best soft leather I had ever seen, and the two pictures on the wall were originals-a Renoir and a Monet. My God, millions! I thought.\n",
            "   “Okay,” I said. “The beasts, you said. Youll kill them, not me?”\n",

            "   And before I could prevent, he gave the brass machine a terrific slap with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another, with both fists, cursing. Then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of a spoiled child and throttled and shook it.\n",
            "   I cannot say what I heard in that instant. Perhaps real sounds, perhaps imagined temblors, like a glacier\n",
            "   cracking in the spring, or icicles in mid-night. Perhaps it was a sound like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in folds of tissue. Maybe I thought I heard a vast breath in sucked, a cloud dissolving up inside itself. Or did I sense clock machineries spun so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass snowflakes?\n",
            "   I put my eye to the periscope.\n",
            "   I looked in upon—\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",

            "   No more.\n",
            "   I seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an unimaginable horizon.\n",
            "   But the couch remained only a couch, and the wall beyond looked back at me with its great blank face.\n",
            "   Von Seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to fall on one rusted fist.\n",

            "   He clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp\n",
            "   of prayer, like one who beseeches God to deliver him from plagues. And whether he was once again praying for my death, eyes shut, or whether he simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device, I could not say.\n",
            "   I only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing. Me and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this incredible captain from beneath Nemos tidal seas.\n",
            "   “Gone,” murmured Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, whispered for the last time. “Gone.”\n",

            "   I looked up at the ceiling. It was empty.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said the landlord. “Didnt they fix it so you cant see? Damn fool Baron made a damn big hole up into the office above. Rented that, too, but never used it for anything I knew of. There was just that big damn hole he left when he went away.”\n",

            "   “Thats mainly fireworks, gunpowder plots, Houses of Parliament, yes? Please to remember the fifth of November?”\n",
            "   “Do you think you could wait until then?”\n",
            "   “I could try. I dont think I want to start out with skulls and bones. Gunpowders more like it. I could write about that.”\n",
            "   “Will you be a writer, then?”\n",
            "   “Get me a typewriter and a ream of paper.”\n",
            "   “And keep us awake with the typing?”\n",
            "   “Pen, pencil, and pad, then?”\n",
            "   “Done!”\n",
            "   So it was agreed and the nights passed into weeks and the weeks leaned from summer into the first days of autumn and his voice grew stronger,\n",
            "   as did the sound of his heart and the small commotions of his limbs. Sometimes as Maggie slept, his voice would stir her awake and she would reach up to touch her mouth, where the surprise of his dreaming came forth.\n",
            "   “There, there, Sascha. Rest now. Sleep.”\n",
            "   “Sleep,” he whispered drowsily, “sleep.” And faded away.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Pork chops, please, for supper.”\n",
            "   “No pickles with ice cream?” both said, almost at once.\n",
            "   “Pork chops,” he said, and more days passed and more dawns arose and he said: “Hamburgers!”\n",
            "   “For breakfast?”\n",
            "   “With onions,” he said.\n",
            "   October stood still for one day and then...\n",
            "   Halloween departed.\n",
            "   “Thanks,” said Sascha, “for helping me past that. Whats up ahead in five nights?”\n",
            "   “Guy Fawkes!”\n",
            "   “Ah, yes!” he cried.\n",
            "   And at one minute after midnight five days later, Maggie got up, wandered to the bathroom, and wandered back, stunned.\n",
            "   “Dear,” she said, sitting on the edge of the bed.\n",
            "   Douglas Spaulding turned over, half awake. “Yes?”\n",
            "   “What day is it?” whispered Sascha.\n",
            "   “Guy Fawkes, at last. So?”\n",
            "   “I dont feel well,” said Sascha. “Or, no, I feel fine. Full of pep. Ready to go. Its time to say good-bye. Or is it hello? What do I mean?”\n",
            "   “Spit it out.”\n",
            "   “Are there neighbors who said, no matter when, theyd take us to the hospital?”\n",
            "   “Yes. “”\n",
            "   “Call the neighbors,” said Sascha.\n",
            "   They called the neighbors.\n",
            "   At the hospital, Douglas kissed his and listened.\n",
            "   “Its been nice,” said Sascha.\n",
            "   “Only the best.”\n",
            "   “We wont talk again. Good-bye,” said Sascha.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” both said.\n",
            "   At dawn there was a small clear cry somewhere. Not long after, Douglas entered his wifes hospital room. She looked at him and said\n",
            "   “Saschas gone.”\n",
            "   “I know,” he said quietly.\n",
            "   “But he left word and someone else is here.\n",
            "   Look.”\n",
            "   He approached the bed as she pulled back a coverlet.\n",
            "   “Well, Ill be damned.”\n",
            "   He looked down at a small pink face and eyes that for a brief moment flickered bright blue and\n",
            "   then shut.\n",
            "   “Whos that?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Your daughter. Meet Alexandra.”\n",
            "   “Hello, Alexandra,” he said.\n",
            "   “And do you know what the nickname for Alexandra is?” she said.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Sascha,” she said.\n",
            "   He touched the small cheek very gently.\n",
            "   “Hello, Sascha,” he said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "ANOTHER FINE MESS\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The sounds began in the middle of summer in the middle of the night.\n",
            "   Bella Winters sat up in bed about three a. m. and listened and then lay back down. Ten minutes later she heard the sounds again, out in the night, down the hill.\n",
            "   Bella Winters lived in a first-floor apartment on top of Vendome Heights, near Effie Street in Los Angeles, and had lived there now for only a few days, so it was all new to her, this old house on an old street with an old staircase, made of concrete, climbing steeply straight up from the low-lands below, one hundred and twenty steps, count them. And right now... \n",
            "   “Someones on the steps,” said Bella to herself.\n",
            "   “What?” said her husband, Sam, in his sleep.\n",
            "   “There are some men out on the steps,” said Bella. “Talking, yelling, not fighting, but almost. I heard them last night, too, and the night before, but...\n",
            "   “What?” Sam muttered.\n",
            "   “Shh, go to sleep. Ill look.”\n",
            "   She got out of bed in the dark and went to the window, and yes, two men were indeed talking out there, grunting, groaning, now loud, now soft. And there was another noise, a kind of bumping, sliding, thumping, like a huge object being carted up the hill.\n",
            "   “No one could be moving in at this hour of the night, could they?” asked Bella of the darkness, the window, and herself.\n",
            "   “No,” murmured Sam.\n",
            "   “It sounds like...\n",
            "   “Like what?” asked Sam, fully awake now.\n",
            "   “Like two men moving—”\n",
            "   “Moving what, for Gods sake?”\n",
            "   “Moving a piano. Up those steps. “”\n",
            "   “At three in the morning!?”\n",
            "   “A piano and two men. Just listen.”\n",
            "   The husband sat up, blinking, alert.\n",
            "   Far off, in the middle of the hill, there was a kind harping strum, the noise a piano makes when suddenly thumped and its harp strings hum.\n",
            "   “There, did you hear?”\n",
            "   “Jesus, youre right. But why would anyone steal—”\n",
            "   “Theyre not stealing, theyre delivering.”\n",
            "   “A piano?”\n",
            "   “I didnt make the rules, Sam. Go out and ask. No, dont; I will.”\n",
            "   And she wrapped herself in her robe and was out the door and on the sidewalk.\n",
            "   “Bella,” Sam whispered fiercely behind the porch screen. “Crazy.”\n",
            "   “So what can happen at night to a woman fifty-five, fat, and ugly?” she wondered.\n",
            "   Sam did not answer.\n",
            "   She moved quietly to the rim of the hill. Somewhere down there she could hear the two men wrestling with a huge object. The piano on occasion gave a strumming hum and fell silent. occasionally one of the men yelled or gave orders.\n",
            "   “The voices,” said Bella. “I know them from somewhere,” she whispered and moved in utter dark on stairs that were only a long pale ribbon going down, as a voice echoed:\n",
            "   “Heres another fine mess youve got us in.” Bella froze. Where have I heard that voice, she wondered, a million times!\n",
            "   “Hello,” she called.\n",
            "   She moved, counting the steps, and stopped.\n",
            "   And there was no one there.\n",
            "   Suddenly she was very cold. There was nowhere for the strangers to have gone to. The hill was steep and a long way down and a long way up, and they had been burdened with an upright piano, hadnt they?\n",
            "   How come I know upright? she thought. I only heard. But-yes, upright! Not only that, but inside a box!\n",
            "   She turned slowly and as she went back up the steps, one by one, slowly, slowly, the voices began to sound again, below, as if, disturbed, they had waited for her to go away.\n",
            "   “What are you doing?” demanded one voice.\n",
            "   “I was just—” said the other.\n",
            "   “Give me that!” cried the first voice.\n",
            "   That other voice, thought Bella, I know that, too. And I know whats going to be said !\n",
            "   “Now,” said the echo far down the hill in the night, “just dont stand there, help me!”\n",
            "   “Yes!” Bella closed her eyes and swallowed hard and half fell to sit on the steps, getting her breath back as black-and-White pictures flashed in her head. Suddenly it was 1929 and she Was very small, in a theater with dark and light pictures looming above the first row where she sat, transfixed, and then laughing, and then transfixed and laughing again.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   She opened her eyes. The two voices were still down there, a faint wrestle and echo in the night, despairing and thumping each other with their hard derby hats.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Zelda, thought Bella Winters. Ill call Zelda. She knows everything. Shell tell me what this is. Zelda, yes!\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Inside, she dialed Z and E and L and D and A before she saw what she had done and started over. The phone rang a long while until Zeldas voice, angry with sleep, spoke half way across L. A.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Zelda, this is Bella!”\n",
            "   “Sam just died?”\n",
            "   “No, no, Im sorry—”\n",
            "   “Youre sorry?”\n",
            "   “Zelda, I know youre going to think Im crazy, but...”\n",
            "   “Go ahead, be crazy.”\n",
            "   “Zelda, in the old days when they made films around L. A., they used lots of places, right? Like Venice, Ocean Park...”\n",
            "   “Chaplin did, Langdon did, Harold Lloyd, sure.”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Laurel and Hardy, did they use lots of locations?”\n",
            "   “Palms, they used Palms lots, Culver City Main Street,” Effie Street.”\n",
            "   “Effie Street!”\n",
            "   “Dont yell, Bella.”\n",
            "   “Did you say Effie Street?”\n",
            "   “Sure, and God, its three in the morning!”\n",
            "   “Right at the top of Effie Street!?”\n",
            "   “Hey, yeah, the stairs. Everyone knows them. Thats where the music box chased Hardy downhill and ran over Him.”\n",
            "   “Sure, Zelda, sure! Oh, God, Zelda, if you could see, hear, what I hear!”\n",
            "   Zelda was suddenly wide awake on the line. “Whats going on? You serious?”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, yes. On the steps just now, and last night and the night before maybe, I heard, I hear—two men hauling a—a piano up the hill.”\n",
            "   “Someones pulling your leg!”\n",
            "   “No, no, theyre there. I go out and theres nothing. But the steps are haunted, Zelda! One voice says: “Heres another fine mess youve got us in. “You got to hear that mans voice!”\n",
            "   “Youre drunk and doing this because you know Im a nut for them.”\n",
            "   “No, no. Come, Zelda. Listen. Tell!”\n",
            "   Maybe half an hour later, Bella heard the old tin lizzie rattle up the alley behind the apartments. It was a car Zelda, in her joy at visiting silent-movie theaters, had bought to lug herself around in while she wrote about the past, always the past, and steaming into Cecil B. DeMilles old place or circling Harold Lloyds nation-state, or cranking and banging around the Universal backlot, paying her respects to the Phantoms opera stage, or sitting on Ma and Pa Kettles porch chewing a sandwich lunch. That was Zelda, who once wrote in a silent country in a silent time for Silver Screen.\n",
            "   Zelda lumbered across the front porch, a huge body with legs as big as the Bernini columns in front of St. Peters in Rome, and a face like a harvest moon.\n",
            "   On that round face now was suspicion, cynicism, skepticisms, in equal pie-parts. But when she saw Bellas pale stare she cried:\n",
            "   “Belle!”\n",
            "   “You see Im not lying!” said Bella.\n",
            "   “I see!”\n",
            "   “Keep your voice down, Zelda. Oh, its scary and strange, terrible and nice. So come on.”\n",
            "   And the two women edged along the walk to the rim of the old hill near the old steps in old Hollywood, and suddenly as they moved they felt time take a half turn around them and it was another year, because nothing had changed all the buildings were the way they were in 1928 and the hills beyond like they were in 1926 and the steps, just the, way they were when the cement was poured in 1921.\n",
            "   “Listen, Zelda. There!”\n",
            "   And Zelda listened and at first there was only a creaking of wheels down in the dark, like crickets, and then a moan of wood and a hum of piano strings, and then one voice lamenting about this job, and the other voice claiming he had nothing to do with it, and then the thumps as two derby hats fell, and an exasperated voice announced:\n",
            "   “Heres another fine mess youve got us in.”\n",
            "   Zelda, stunned, almost toppled off the hill. She held tight to Bellas arm as tears brimmed in her eyes.\n",
            "   “Its a trick. Someones got a tape recorder or—”\n",
            "   “No, I checked. Nothing but the steps, Zelda, the steps!”\n",
            "   Tears rolled down Zeldas plump cheeks.\n",
            "   “Oh, God, that is his voice! Im the expert, Im the mad, fanatic, Bella. Thats Ollie. And that other voice, Stan! And youre not nuts after all!”\n",
            "   The voices below rose and fell and one cried: “Why dont you do something to help me?”\n",
            "   Zelda moaned. “Oh, God, its so beautiful.”\n",
            "   “What does it mean?” asked Bella. “Why are they here? Are they really ghosts, and why would ghosts climb this hill every night, pushing that music box, night after night, tell me, Zelda, why?”\n",
            "   Zelda peered down the hill and shut her eyes for a moment to think. “Why do any ghosts go anywhere? Retribution? Revenge? No, not those two. Love maybes the reason, lost loves or something Yes?”\n",
            "   Bella let her heart pound once or twice and then said, “Maybe nobody told them.”\n",
            "   “Told them what?”\n",
            "   “Or maybe they were told a lot but still didnt believe, because maybe in their old years things got bad, I mean they were sick, and sometimes when youre sick you forget.”\n",
            "   “Forget what!?”\n",
            "   “How much we loved them.”\n",
            "   “They knew!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Did they? Sure, we told each other, but maybe not enough of us ever wrote or waved when they passed and just yelled “Love!” you think?”\n",
            "   “Hell, Bella, theyre on TV every night!”\n",
            "   “Yeah, but that dont count. Has anyone, since they left us, come here to these steps and said? Maybe those voices down there, ghosts or whatever, have been here every night for years, pushing that music box, and nobody thought, or tried, to just whisper or yell all the love we had all the years. Why not?”\n",
            "   “Why not?” Zelda stared down into the long darkness where perhaps shadows moved and maybe a piano lurched clumsily among the shadows. “Youre right.”\n",
            "   If Im right,” said Bella, “and you say so, theres only one thing to do—”\n",
            "   “You mean you and me?”\n",
            "   “Who else? Quiet. Come on.”\n",
            "   They moved down a step. In the same instant lights came on around them, in a window here, another there. A screen door opened somewhere and angry words shot out into the night:\n",
            "   “Hey, whats going on?”\n",
            "   “Pipe down!”\n",
            "   “You know what time it is?” “My God,” Bella whispered, “everyone else hears now!”\n",
            "   “No, no.” Zelda looked around wildly. “Theyll spoil everything!”\n",
            "   “Im calling the cops!” A window slammed.\n",
            "   “God,” said Bella, “if the cops come—”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Itll be all wrong. If anyones going to tell them to take it easy, pipe down, its gotta be us. We care, dont we?”\n",
            "   “God, yes, but—”\n",
            "   “No buts. Grab on. Here we go.”\n",
            "   The two voices murmured below and the piano tuned itself with hiccups of sound as they edged down another step and another, their mouths dry, hearts hammering, and the night so dark they could see only the faint streetlight at the stair bottom, the single street illumination so far away it was sad being there all by itself, waiting for shadows to move.\n",
            "   More windows slammed up, more screen doors opened. At any moment there would be an avalanche of protest, incredible outcries, perhaps shots fired, and all this gone forever.\n",
            "   Thinking this, the women trembled and held tight, as if to pummel each other to speak against the rage.\n",
            "   “Say something, Zelda, quick.”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Anything! Theyll get hurt if we dont—”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know what I mean. Save them.”\n",
            "   “Okay. Jesus!” Zelda froze, clamped her eyes shut to find the words, then opened her eyes and said, “Hello.”\n",
            "   “Louder.”\n",
            "   “Hello,” Zelda called softly, then loudly.\n",
            "   Shapes rustled in the dark below. One of the voices rose while the other fell and the piano strummed its hidden harp strings.\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called\n",
            "   “Thats good. Go on.”\n",
            "   “Dont be afraid,” Zelda called, braver now. “Dont listen to those others yelling. We wont hurt you. Its just us. Im Zelda, you wouldnt remember, and this here is Bella, and weve known you forever, or since we were kids, and we love you. Its late, but we thought you should know. Weve loved you ever since you were in the desert or on that boat with ghosts or trying to sell Christmas trees door-to-door or in that traffic where you tore the headlights off cars, and we still love you, right, Bella?”\n",
            "   The night below was darkness, waiting.\n",
            "   Zelda punched Bellas arm.\n",
            "   “Yes!” Bella cried, “what she said. We love you.”\n",
            "   “We cant think of anything else to say.”\n",
            "   “But its enough, yes?” Bella leaned forward anxiously. “Its enough?”\n",
            "   A night wind stirred the leaves and grass around the stairs and the shadows below that had stopped moving with the music box suspended between them as they looked up and up at the two women, who suddenly began to cry. First tears fell from Bellas cheeks, and when Zelda sensed them, she let fall her own.\n",
            "   “So now,” said Zelda, amazed that she could form words but managed to speak anyway, “we want you to know, you don t have to come back anymore. You dont have to climb\n",
            "   the hill every night, waiting. For what we said just now is it, isnt it? I mean you wanted to hear it here on this hill, with those steps, and that piano, yes, thats the whole thing, it had to be that, didnt it? So now here we are and there you are and its said. So rest, dear friends.”\n",
            "   “Oh, there, Ollie,” added Bella in a sad, sad whisper. “Oh, Stan, Stanley.”\n",
            "   The piano, hidden in the dark, softly hummed its wires and creaked its ancient wood.\n",
            "   And then the most incredible thing happened. There was: a series of shouts and then a huge banging crash as the music box, in the dark, rocketed down the hill, skittering on the steps, playing chords where it hit, swerving, rushing, and ahead of it, running, the two shapes pursued by the musical beast, yelling, tripping, shouting, warning the Fates, crying out to the gods, down and down, forty, sixty, eighty, one hundred steps.\n",
            "   And half down the steps, hearing, feeling, shouting, crying themselves, and now laughing and holding to each other, the two women alone in the night wildly clutching, grasping, trying to see, almost sure that they did see, the three things ricocheting off and away, the two shadows rushing, one fat,, one thin, and the piano blundering after, discordant and mindless, until they reached the street, where, instantly, the one overhead streetlamp died as if struck, and the shadows floundered on, pursued by the musical beast.\n",
            "   And the two women, abandoned, looked down, exhausted with laughing until they wept and weeping until they laughed, until suddenly Zelda got a terrible look on her face as if shot.\n",
            "   “My God!” she shouted in panic, reaching out. “Wait. We didnt mean, we dont want-dont go forever! Sure, go. so the neighbors here sleep. But once a year, you hear? Once a year, one night a year from tonight, and every year after that, come back. It shouldnt bother anyone so much. But we got to tell you all over again, huh? Come back and bring the box with you, and well be here waiting, wont we, Bella?”\n",
            "   “Waiting, yes.”\n",
            "   There was a long silence from the steps leading down into an old black-and-white, silent Los Angeles.\n",
            "   “You think they heard?”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   And from somewhere far off and down, there was the faintest explosion like the engine of an old jalopy knocking itself to life, and then the merest whisper of a lunatic music from a dark theater when they were very young. It faded.\n",
            "   After a long while they climbed back up the steps, dabbing at their eyes with wet Kleenex. Then they turned for a final time to stare down into the night.\n",
            "   “You know something?” said Zelda. “I think they heard.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "THE ELECTROCUTION\n",
            "   \n",
            "   She let him tie the black silk over her eyes and he knotted it and jerked it so tight that she gasped and said, “Loosen it, damn you, Johnny, loosen it, or I wont go on!”?\n",
            "   “Sure,” he said easily, and she smelled his sharp breath; while beyond; the crowd rustled against the rope barrier and the carnival tent flapped in the night wind, and off, there was a drift of calliope music and the rattle of a trap drum.\n",
            "   Dimly, through the black silk, she could see the men, the boys, the few women, a good crowd, paying out dimes to see her strapped in this electric chair, the electrodes on her wrists and neck, waiting.\n",
            "   “There.” Johnnys voice whispered through the blindfold. “That better?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but her hands gripped the ends of the wooden chair. She felt her pulse beating in her arms and neck... Outside the pitchman yelled through his small cardboard megaphone and slapped his cane across the banner where Electras portrait shivered in the wind: yellow hair, hard blue eyes, sharp chin, seated in her death-chair like Someone come for tea.\n",
            "   With the black silk blinding her, it was easier to let her mind run back to wherever it wanted to go...\n",
            "   The carnival was either setting up in a new town or letting go; its brown tents inhaling by day, exhaling its stale air by night as the canvases slid rustling down along the dark poles. And then?\n",
            "   Last Monday night this young man with the long arms and the eager pink face bought three tickets to the sideshow and stood watching Electra three times as the electricity burned through her like blue fire while this young man strained at the rope barrier, and memorized her every move as she sat high up there on the platform, all fire and pale flesh.\n",
            "   He came four nights in a row.\n",
            "   “You got an audience, Ellie,” said Johnny on the third night.\n",
            "   “So I see,” she said.\n",
            "   “Dont pay no attention,” said Johnny.\n",
            "   “I wont,” she said. “Why should I? Dont worry.”\n",
            "   After all, shed done the act for years. Johnny slammed on the power, and it filled her from ankle to elbows to ears as he handed her the bright sword and she thrust it out blindly over the audience, smiling under her half mask, to let them tap shoulders and brows as the blue sparks crackled and spat. On the fourth night she shoved the sword far out toward the young man with the sweating pink face, first among the crowd. The young man raised his hand swiftly, eagerly, as if to seize the blade. Blue sparks leaped the gap, but his hand didnt flinch or stop as he grabbed on and took the fire in his fingers and then his fist and then his wrist and his arm into his body.\n",
            "   His eyes, in the light, flared with blue alcohol flame, fed by the sword, whose fire in passing lit her arm and face and body. He stretched his hand still farther out, his waist jammed against the rope, silent and tense. Then Johnny cried, “Everybody touch it! Every one!” And Electra lifted the blade out on the air for others to feel and stroke, while Johnny cursed. Through the blindfold she saw the terrible illumination which would not leave the young mans face.\n",
            "   The fifth night, instead of touching the young mans fingers, she tapped the blazing tip of the sword against the palm of his hand, brushing and burning until he shut his eyes.\n",
            "   That night she walked out on the lake pier after the show and did not look back as she moved, but listened and began to smile. The lake shook against the rotting piles. The carnival lights made wandering, uneasy roads on the black water. The Ferris wheel whirled high and around, with its faint screams, and far away the calliope steamed and sobbed “Beautiful Ohio.” She slowed her walking. She put out her right foot, slowly, then her left, then she stopped and turned her head. And as she turned she saw the shadow, and his arms moved around her. A long time later she leaned back in his arms and stared up into his healthy, excited pink face, and said, “My God, youre more dangerous than my chair!”\n",
            "   “Is your name really Electra?” he said.\n",
            "   The  night as the power leaped through her, she stiffened, shuddered, and clamped her lips in her teeth, moaning. Her legs stirred; her hands groped and scratched the chair arms.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong!” Beyond the blindfold, Johnny cried out, “What?”\n",
            "   And cut the power.\n",
            "   “Im all right,” she gasped. The crowd murmured. “Its nothing Go on! Now!”\n",
            "   And he hit the switch.\n",
            "   The fire crawled through her and again she clenched her teeth and threw her head back against the chair. A face rushed out of the dark, and a body with it, to press against her. The power exploded. The electric chair stopped, then melted.\n",
            "   Johnny, a million miles off in the dark, handed her the sword. Her limp, twitching hand dropped it. He handed it back and instinctively she shoved it far out into the night.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Someone, out there in the roaring darkness, touched the blade. She could imagine his eyes burning there, his lips parted as the power jolted him. He was pressed against the rope, hard, hard against the rope, and could not breathe or cry out or pull back!\n",
            "   The power died. The smell of lightning stayed.\n",
            "   “Thats it!” someone cried.\n",
            "   Johnny left her to squirm out of the leather straps, jumped off the low platform, and walked out toward the midway. Convulsively, she tore off the bonds, trembling. She ran from the tent, not looking back to see if the young man was still there against the rope.\n",
            "   She fell upon the cot of the trailer behind the tent, perspiring and shaking, and was still crying when Johnny stepped in to look down at her.\n",
            "   “Whats the matter?” he said.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing, Johnny.”\n",
            "   “What was that you pulled out there just now?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing.”\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing,” he said. “Like hell it is.” His face twisted. “Like hell! You havent done anything like that for years!”\n",
            "   “I was nervous!”\n",
            "   “Years its been,” he said. “When we were first married you did that. You think I forgot how when I switched the power on this same happened like tonight? You been sitting in that chair for three years like someone listening to a radio. And tonight, and tonight!” he cried, choking, standing over her, his fists tightened. “Damn it, tonight.”\n",
            "   “Please, please, Johnny. I was nervous.”\n",
            "   “What were you thinking there in the chair?” he demanded, leaning down wildly. “What did you think about?”\n",
            "   “Nothing, Johnny, nothing. “He grabbed her hair. “Please!”\n",
            "   He threw her head down, turned, walked out, and stopped outside. “I know what you were thinking,” he said. “I know.” And she heard his footsteps fade away.\n",
            "   And the night passed and the day and another night with another crowd.\n",
            "   But nowhere in the crowd did she see his face. Now, in the blackness, with the blindfold tight to her face, she sat in the electric chair and waited while Johnny described the wonders of the Skeleton Man over on the  platform, and still she waited and stared at everyone who entered the tent. Johnny walked around the Skeleton Man, all stiffness, describing the living skull and the terrible bones, and at last the crowd rustled, turned, led by Johnny, his voice like a battered brass horn as he jumped up onto the platform with her so violently that she jerked aside and licked her red lips.\n",
            "   And now the knot of the blindfold was tied tighter and yet tighter as he bent to whisper:\n",
            "   “Miss him?”\n",
            "   She said nothing, but held her head up. The crowd stirred below, like animals in a straw stable.\n",
            "   “Hes not here,” he whispered and locked the electrodes on her arms. She was silent. He whispered again, “Hell never come back.” He fitted the black skullcap over her hair. She trembled. “Afraid?” he wondered quietly. “What of?” He snapped the straps around her ankles. “Dont be afraid. Good clean electricity.” A gasp escaped her lips. He stood up. “I hit him,” he said softly, touching her blindfold. “Hit him so hard I broke his front teeth. Then I knocked him against a wall and hit him again and again—” He Stopped and shouted. “Ladies and gentlemen, witness the most astounding act in carnival history! Here you see a penitentiary electric chair exactly like those used in our biggest prisons. Perfect for the destruction of criminals!” With this last word she fell forward, fingers scratching the wood as he cried, “Before your very eyes, this dear lady will be electrocuted!”\n",
            "   The crowd murmured, and she thought of the tesla transformer under the platform and how Johnny might have fixed it so she got amperage, not voltage. Accident, bad accident Shame. Amperage, not voltage.\n",
            "   She wrenched her right hand free of its leather strap and heard the power switch slam shut as the blue fire seized and shook her, screaming!\n",
            "   The audience applauded and whistled and stomped. Oh she thought wildly, this is good, my death? Great! More applause! More screams!\n",
            "   Out of the black spaces a body fell. “Hit him so hard broke his teeth!” The body jerked. “Then I hit him and hit him again!” The body fell, was picked up, fell again. She screamed high and long as a million unseen mouths stung and bit her. Blue flames seized her heart. The young man” body writhed and exploded in bone shrapnel, flame, and ash\n",
            "   Calmly, Johnny handed her the sword.\n",
            "   “Now,” he said.\n",
            "   Being safe was like a blow to the stomach.\n",
            "   She sobbed, fumbling at the sword, quivering and jerking unable to move. The power hummed and the crowd stuck out their hands, some like spiders, some like birds leaping away wherever the sword sizzled and spat.\n",
            "   The power still lived in her bones as all over the carnival grounds the lights dimmed.\n",
            "   Click. The switch lay in its Off bed.\n",
            "   She sank in upon herself, the sweat running around her nose and her sagging mouth. Gasping, she fought free to pull the blindfold away.\n",
            "   The crowd had gone off to another platform, another miracle, where the Fat Lady called and they obeyed.\n",
            "   Johnnys hand lay on the switch. He dropped his hand, stood there watching her, his dark eyes cold, not flickering.\n",
            "   The tent lights looked dirty, old, yellow, and unclean. She stared blindly at the retreating crowd, Johnny, the tent, the lights. She looked shrunken in the chair. Half of her had poured out through the wires, flushed into the copper cable that fled over the town, leaping from high pole to pole. She lifted her head as if it weighed ninety pounds. The clean light had come, entered into and slid through her, and blasted out again; but it was not the same light anymore. She had changed it; she saw how she had made it. And she shivered because the light was discolored.\n",
            "   Johnnys mouth opened. She didnt hear him at first. He had to repeat what had to be said.\n",
            "   “Youre dead,” he said firmly. And again: “Youre dead.”\n",
            "   And sitting there in the electric chair, trapped by the leather straps, with a wind from the tent flaps playing over her face, evaporating the wetness, staring at him and seeing the dark in his eyes, she gave the only answer it was possible to give.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said, eyes shut. “Oh, yes. I am.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "\n",
            "HOPSCOTCH\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Vinia woke to the sound of a rabbit running down and across an endless moonlit field; but it was only the soft, quick beating of her heart. She lay on the bed for a moment, getting her breath. Now the sound of the running faded and was gone at a great distance. At last she sat up and looked down from her second-story bedroom window and there below, on the long sidewalk, in the faint moonlight before dawn, was the hopscotch.\n",
            "   Late yesterday, some child had chalked it out, immense and endlessly augmented, square upon square, line after line, numeral following numeral. You could not see the end of it. Down the street it built its crazy pattern, 3, 4, 5, on up to 10, then 30, 50, 90, on away to turn far corners. Never in all the childrens world a hopscotch like this! You could Jump forever toward the horizon.\n",
            "   Now in the very early, very quiet morning, her eyes traveled and jumped, paused and hopped, along that presumptuous ladder of chalk-scratches and she heard herself whisper:\n",
            "   “Sixteen.”\n",
            "   But she did not run on from there.\n",
            "   The  square waited, she knew, with the scribbled blue chalk 17, but her mind flung out its arms and balanced, teetering, poised with her numb foot planted across the 1 and the 6, and could go no further.\n",
            "   Trembling, she lay back down.\n",
            "   The room was like the bottom of a cool well all night and she lay in it like a white stone in a well, enjoying it, floating in the dark yet clear element of half dreams and half wakening. She felt the breath move in small jets from her nostrils and she felt the immense sweep of her eyelids shutting and opening again and again. And at last she felt the fever brought into her room by the presence of the sun beyond the hills.\n",
            "   Morning, she thought. It might be a special day. After all, its my birthday. Anything might happen. And I hope it does.\n",
            "   The air moved the white curtains like a summer breath.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   A voice was calling. But it couldnt be a voice. Yet-Vinia raised herself-there it was again.\n",
            "   “Vinia...?”\n",
            "   She slipped from bed and ran to the window of her high second-story window.\n",
            "   There on the fresh lawn below, calling up to her in the early hour, stood James Conway, no older than she, seventeen, very seriously smiling, waving his hand now as her head appeared.\n",
            "   “Jim, whatre you doing here?” she said, and thought, Does he know what day this is?\n",
            "   “Ive been up an hour already,” he replied. “Im going for a walk, starting early, all day. Want to come along?”\n",
            "   Oh but I couldnt... my folks wont be back till late tonight, Im alone, Im supposed to stay...”\n",
            "   She saw the green hills beyond the town and the roads leading out into summer, leading out into August and rivers and places beyond this town and this house and this room and this particular moment.\n",
            "   “I cant go...” she said faintly.\n",
            "   “I cant hear you!” he protested mildly, smiling up at her under a shielding hand.\n",
            "   “Why did you ask me to walk with you, and not someone else?”\n",
            "   He considered this for a moment. “I dont know,” he admitted. He thought it over again, and gave her his most pleasant and agreeable look. “Because, thats all, just because.”\n",
            "   “Ill be down,” she said.\n",
            "   “Hey!” he said.\n",
            "   But the window was empty.\n",
            "   They stood in the center of the perfect, jeweled lawn, over which one set of prints, hers, had run, leaving marks, and another, his, had walked in great slow strides to meet them. The town was silent as a stopped clock. All the shades were still down.\n",
            "   “My gosh,” said Vinia, “its early. Its crazy-early. Ive never been up this early and out this early in years. Listen to everyone sleeping.”\n",
            "   They listened to the trees and the whiteness of the houses in this early whispering hour, the hour when mice went back to sleep and flowers began untightening their bright fists.\n",
            "   “Which way do we go?”\n",
            "   “Pick a direction.”\n",
            "   Vinia closed her eyes, whirled, and pointed blindly. “Which way am I pointing?”\n",
            "   “North.”\n",
            "   She opened her eyes. “Lefts go north out of town, then. I dont suppose we should.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   And they walked out of town as the sun rose above the hills and the grass burned greener on the lawns.\n",
            "   There was a smell of hot chalk highway, of dust and sky and waters flowing in a creek the color of grapes. The sun was a new lemon. The forest lay ahead with shadows stirring like a million birds under each tree, each bird a leaf-darkness, trembling. At noon, Vinia and James Conway had crossed vast meadows that sounded brisk and starched underfoot. The day had grown warm, as an iced glass of tea grows warm, the frost burning off, left in the sun.\n",
            "   They picked a handful of grapes from a wild barbed-wire vine. Holding them up to the sun, you could see the clear grape thoughts suspended in the dark amber fluid, the little hot seeds of contemplation stored from many afternoons of solitude and plant philosophy. The grapes tasted of fresh, clear water and something that they had saved from the morning dews and the evening rains. They were the warmed-over flesh of April ready now, in August, to pass on their simple gain to any passing stranger. And the lesson was this; sit in the sun, head down, within a prickly vine, in flickery light or open light, and the world will come to you. The sky will come in its time, bringing rain, and the earth will rise through you, from beneath, and make you rich and make you full.\n",
            "   “Have a grape,” said James Conway. “Have two.”\n",
            "   They munched their wet, full mouths.\n",
            "   They sat on the edge of a brook and took off their shoes and let the water cut their feet off to the ankles with an exquisite cold razor.\n",
            "   My feet are gone! thought Vinia. But when she looked, there they were, underwater, living comfortably apart from her, completely acclimated to an amphibious existence.\n",
            "   They ate egg sandwiches Jim had brought with him in a paper sack.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” said Jim, looking at his sandwich before he bit it. “would you mind if I kissed you?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” she said, after a moment. “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Will you think it over?” he asked.\n",
            "   “Did we come on this picnic just so you could kiss me?” she asked suddenly.\n",
            "   “Oh, dont get me wrong! Its been a swell day! I dont want to spoil it. But if you should decide, later, that its all right for me to kiss you, would you tell me?”\n",
            "   “Ill tell you,” she said, starting on her second sandwich, “if I ever decide.”\n",
            "   The rain came as a cool surprise.\n",
            "   It smelled of soda water and limes and oranges and the cleanest, freshest river in the world, made of snow-water, falling from the high, parched sky.\n",
            "   First there had been a motion, as of veils, in the sky. The clouds had enveloped each other softly. A faint breeze had lifted Vinias hair, sighing and evaporating the moisture from her upper lip, and then, as she and Jim began to run, the raindrops fell down all about without touching them and then at last began to touch them, coolly, as they leaped green-moss logs and darted among vast trees into the deepest, muskiest cavern of the forest. The forest sprang up in wet murmurs overhead, every leaf ringing and painted fresh with water.\n",
            "   “This way!” cried Jim.\n",
            "   And they reached a hollow tree so vast that they could squeeze in and be warmly cozy from the rain. They stood together, arms about each other, the first coldness from the rain making them shiver, raindrops on their noses and cheeks, laughing. “Hey!” He gave her brow a lick. “Drinking water!”\n",
            "   “Jim!”\n",
            "   They listened to the rain, the soft envelopment of the world in the velvet clearness of falling water, the whispers in deep grass, evoking odors of old, wet wood and leaves that had lain a hundred years, moldering and sweet.\n",
            "   Then they heard another sound. Above and inside the hollow warm darkness of the tree was a constant humming, like someone in a kitchen, far away, baking and crusting pies contentedly, dipping in sweet sugars and snowing in baking powders, someone in a warm, dim, summer-rainy kitchen making a vast supply of food, happy at it, humming between lips over it.\n",
            "   “Bees, Jim, up there! Bees!”\n",
            "   “Shh!”\n",
            "   Up the channel of moist, warm hollow they saw little yellow flickers. Now the last bees, wettened, were hurrying home from whatever pasture or meadow or field they had covered, dipping by Vinia and Jim, vanishing up the warm flue of summer into hollow dark.\n",
            "   “They wont bother us. Just stand still.”\n",
            "   Jim tightened his arms; Vinia tightened hers. She could smell his breath with the wild tart grapes still on it. And the harder the rain drummed on the tree, the tighter they held, laughing, at last quietly letting their laughter drain away into the sound of the bees home from the far fields. And for a moment, Vinia thought that she and Jim might be caught by a sudden drop of great masses of honey from above, sealing them into this tree forever, enchanted, in amber, to be seen by anyone in the  thousand years who strolled by, while the weather of all ages rained and thundered and turned green outside the tree.\n",
            "   It was so warm, so safe, so protected here, the world did not exist, there was raining silence, in the sunless, forested day.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” whispered Jim, after a while. “May I now?”\n",
            "   His face was very large, near her, larger than any face she had ever seen.\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said.\n",
            "   He kissed her.\n",
            "   The rain poured hard on the tree for a full minute while everything was cold outside and everything was tree-warmth and hidden away inside.\n",
            "   It was a very sweet kiss. It was very friendly and comfortably warm and it tasted like apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you rise at night and walk into a dark, warm summer kitchen and drink from a cool tin cup. She had never imagined that a kiss could be so sweet and immensely tender and careful of her. He held her not as he had held her a moment before, hard, to protect her from the green rain weather, but he held her now as if she were a porcelain clock, very carefully and with consideration. His eyes were closed and the lashes were glistening dark; she saw this in the instant she opened her eyes and closed them again.\n",
            "   The rain stopped.\n",
            "   It was a moment before the new silence shocked them into an awareness of the climate beyond their world. Now there was nothing but the suspension of water in all the intricate branches of the forest. Clouds moved away to show the blue sky in great quilted patches.\n",
            "   They looked out at the change with some dismay. They waited for the rain to come back, to keep them, by necessity, in this hollow tree for another minute or an hour. But the sun appeared, shining through upon everything, making the scene quite commonplace again.\n",
            "   They stepped from the hollow tree slowly and stood with their hands out, balancing, finding their way, it seemed, in these woods where the water was drying fast on every limb and leaf.\n",
            "   “I think wed better start walking,” said Vinia. “That way.”\n",
            "   They walked off into the summer afternoon.\n",
            "   They crossed the town limits at sunset and walked hand in hand in the last glowing of the summer day. They had talked very little the rest of the afternoon, and now as they turned down one street after another, they looked at the passing sidewalk under their feet.\n",
            "   “Vinia,” he said at last. “Do you think this is the beginning of something?”\n",
            "   “Oh, gosh, Jim, I dont know.”\n",

            "   “Oh, I dont know that either!”\n",
            "   They passed down into the ravine and over the bridge and up the other side to her street.\n",
            "   “Do you think well ever be married?”\n",
            "   “Its too early to tell, isnt it?” she said.\n",
            "   “I guess youre right.” He bit his lip. “Will we go walking again soon?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont know. Lets wait and see, Jim.”\n",
            "   The house was dark, her parents not home yet. They stood on her porch and she shook his hand gravely.\n",
            "   “Thanks, Jim, for a really fine day,” she said.\n",
            "   “Youre welcome,” he said.\n",
            "   They stood there.\n",
            "   Then he turned and walked down the steps and across the dark lawn. At the far edge of lawn he stopped in the shadows and said, “Good night.”\n",
            "   He was almost out of sight, running, when she, in turn, said good night.\n",
            "   In the middle of the night, a sound wakened her.\n",
            "   She half sat up in bed, trying to hear it again. The folks were home, everything was locked and secure, but it hadnt been them. No, this was a special sound. And lying there, looking out at the summer night that had, not long ago, been a summer day, she heard the sound again, and it was a sound of hollowing warmth and moist bark and empty, tunneled tree, the rain outside but comfortable dryness and secretness inside, and it was the sound of bees come home from distant fields, moving upward in the flue of summer into wonderful darkness.\n",
            "   And this sound, she realized, putting her hand up in the summer-night room to touch it, was coming from her drowsy, half-smiling mouth.\n",
            "   Which made her sit bolt upright, and very quietly move downstairs, out through the door, onto the porch, and across the wet-grass lawn to the sidewalk, where the crazed hopscotch chalked itself way off into the future.\n",
            "   Her bare feet hit the first numbers, leaving moist prints up to 10 and 12, thumping, until she stopped at 16, staring down at 17, hesitating, swaying. Then she gritted her teeth, made fists, reared back, and...\n",
            "   Jumped right in the middle of the square 17.\n",
            "   She stood there for a long moment, eyes shut, seeing how it felt.\n",
            "   Then she ran upstairs and lay out on the bed and touched her mouth to see if a summer afternoon was breathing out of it, and listening for that drowsy hum, the golden sound, and it was there.\n",
            "   And it was this sound, eventually, which sang her to sleep.\n",
            "   \n",

            "THE FINNEGAN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   To say that I have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair Finnegan is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final melancholy. Only now, at threescore and ten, can I write these words for an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to unearth my truths or bury my lies.\n",
            "   The facts are these:\n",
            "   Three children went astray and were missed. Their bodies were found in the midst of Chatham Forest and each bore no marks of criminal assassination, but all had suffered their lifeblood to be drained. Only their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes withered by sunlight and no rain.\n",
            "   From the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites. Such myths always pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks. It could only have been a tombyard beast, it was said, that fed on and destroyed three lives and ruined three dozen more.\n",
            "   The children were buried in the most holy ground. Soon after, Sir Robert Merriweather, pretender to the throne of Sherlock Holmes but modestly refusing the claim, moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life. With myself, I might add, to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest.\n",
            "   Sir Robert Merriweather, you say?\n",
            "   Just that. Plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his shut-up house.\n",
            "   Were the doors used? Not one in nine. How had they appeared in Sir Roberts old manse? He had shipped them in, as a collector of doors, from Rio, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, and mid-America. Once collected, he had stashed them, hinged, to be seen from both sides, on the walls of his upper and lower chambers. There he conducted tours of these odd portals for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously overdone, the undersimplified, the rococo, or some First Empire cast aside by Napoleons nephews or seized from Hermann Goering, who had in turn ransacked the Louvre. Others, pelted by Oklahoma dust storms, were jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals buried in the windblown desolations of 1936 America. Name your least favorite door, it was his. Name the best quality, he owned it also, hidden and safe, true beauties behind oblivions portals.\n",
            "   I had come to see his doors, not the deaths. At his behest, which was a command, I had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to find Sir Robert involved not with ten dozen doors, but some great dark door. A mysterious portal, still un-found. And beneath? A tomb.\n",
            "   Sir Robert hurried the grand tour, opening and shutting panels rescued from Peking, long buried near Etna, or filched from Nantucket. But his heart, gone sick, was not in this, what should have been delightful, tour.\n",
            "   He described the spring rains that drenched the country to make things green, only to have people to walk out in that fine weather and one week find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his neck, and in the  weeks, the bodies of the two girls. People shouted for the police and sat drinking in pubs, their faces long and pale, while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the dooms that lay in Chatham Forest.\n",
            "   “Will you come with me,” said Sir Robert at last, “on a very strange, sad picnic?”\n",
            "   “I will,” I said.\n",
            "   So we snapped ourselves in weather-proofs, lugged a hamper of sandwiches and red wine, and plunged into the forest on a drear Sunday.\n",
            "   There was time, as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the trees, to recall what the papers had said about the vanished childrens bloodless flesh, the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times, clueless, while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drum-tight at sunset.\n",
            "   “Rain. Damn. Rain!” Sir Roberts pale face stared up, his gray mustache quivering over his thin mouth. He was sick and brittle and old. “Our picnic will be ruined!”\n",
            "   “Picnic?” I said. “Will our killer join us for eats?”\n",
            "   “I pray to God he will,” Sir Robert said. “Yes, pray to God he will.”\n",
            "   We walked through a land that was now mists, now dim sunlight, now forest, now open glade, until we came into a silent part of the woods, a silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the green moss lay in swards and hillocks. Spring had not yet filled the empty trees. The sun was like an arctic disk, withdrawn, cold, and almost dead.\n",
            "   “This is the place,” said Sir Robert at last.\n",
            "   “Where the children were found?” I inquired.\n",
            "   “Their bodies empty as empty can be.”\n",
            "   I looked at the glade and thought of the children and the people who had stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to whisper and touch and go away, lost.\n",
            "   “The murderer was never apprehended?”\n",
            "   “Not this clever fellow. How observant are you?” asked Sir Robert.\n",
            "   “What do you want observed?”\n",
            "   “Theres the catch. The police slipped up. They were stupidly anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess, seeking a killer with two arms, two legs, a suit of clothes, and a knife. So hypnotized with their human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious unbelievable fact about this place. So!”\n",
            "   He gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth.\n",
            "   Something happened. I stared at the ground. “Do that again,” I whispered.\n",
            "   “You saw it?”\n",
            "   “I thought I saw a small trapdoor open and shut. May I have your cane?”\n",
            "   He gave me the cane. I tapped the ground. It happened again.\n",
            "   “A spider!” I cried. “Gone! God, how quick!”\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” Sir Robert muttered.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You know the old saying: in again, out again, Finnegan. Here.”\n",
            "   With his penknife, Sir Robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of earth, breaking off bits to show me the tunnel. The spider, in panic, leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground.\n",
            "   Sir Robert handed me the tunnel. “Like gray velvet. Feel. A model builder, that small chap. A tiny shelter, camouflaged, and him alert. He could hear a fly walk. Then pounce out, seize, pop back, slam the lid!”\n",
            "   “I didnt know you loved Nature.”\n",
            "   “Loathe it. But this wee chap, theres much we share. Doors. Hinges. Wouldnt consider other arachnids. But my love of portals drew me to study this incredible carpenter.” Sir Robert worked the trap on its cobweb hinges. “What craftsmanship! And it all ties to the tragedies!”\n",
            "   “The murdered children?”\n",
            "   Sir Robert nodded. “Notice any special thing about this forest?”\n",
            "   “Its too quiet.”\n",
            "   “Quiet!” Sir Robert smiled weakly. “Vast quantities of silence. No familiar birds, beetles, crickets, toads. Not a rustle or stir. The police didnt notice. Why should they? But it was this absence of sound and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders.”\n",
            "   He toyed with the amazing structure in his hands.\n",
            "   “What would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough, in a hideout big enough, so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound, be seized, and vanish with a soft thud below. How say you?” Sir Robert stared at the trees. “Poppycock and bilge? Yet, why not? Evolution, selection, growth, mutations, and-pfft!”\n",
            "   Again he tapped with his cane. A trapdoor flew open, shut.\n",
            "   “Finnegan,” he said.\n",
            "   The sky darkened.\n",
            "   “Rain!” Casting a cold gray eye at the clouds, he stretched his frail hand to touch the showers. “Damn! Arachnids hate rain. And so will our huge dark Finnegan.”\n",
            "   “Finnegan!” I cried irritably.\n",
            "   “I believe in him, yes.”\n",
            "   “A spider larger than a child?!”\n",
            "   “Twice as large.”\n",
            "   The cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us. “Lord, I hate to leave. Quick, before we go. Here.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raked away the old leaves with his cane, revealing two globular gray-brown objects.\n",
            "   “What are they?” I bent. “Old cannonballs?”\n",
            "   “No.” He cracked the grayish globes. “Soil, through and through.”\n",
            "   I touched the crumbled bits.\n",
            "   “Our Finnegan excavates,” said Sir Robert. “To make his tunnel. With his large rakelike chelicerae he dislodges soil, works it into a ball, carries it in his jaws, and drops it beyond his hole.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm. “Normal balls evicted from a tiny trapdoor tunnel. Toy-size.” He knocked his cane on the huge globes at our feet. “Explain those!”\n",
            "   I laughed. “The children mustve made them with mud!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense!” cried Sir Robert irritably, glaring about at trees and earth. “By God, somewhere, our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid. We might be standing on it. Christ, dont stare! His door has beveled rims. Some architect, this Finnegan. A genius at camouflage.”\n",
            "   Sir Robert raved on and on, describing the dark earth, the arachnid, its fiddling legs, its hungry mouth, as the wind roared and the trees shook.\n",
            "   Suddenly, Sir Robert flung up his cane.\n",
            "   “No!” he cried.\n",
            "   I had no time to turn. My flesh froze, my heart stopped.\n",
            "   Something snatched my spine.\n",
            "   I thought I heard a huge bottle uncorked, a lid sprung. Then this monstrous thing crawled down my back.\n",
            "   “Here!” cried Sir Robert. “Now!”\n",
            "   He struck with his cane. I fell, dead weight. He thrust the thing from my spine. He lifted it.\n",
            "   The wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it onto my back.\n",
            "   Weakly, I tried to rise, shivering. “Silly,” I said a dozen times. “Silly. Damn awful silly!”\n",
            "   “Silly, no. Brandy, yes!” said Sir Robert. “Brandy?”\n",
            "   The sky was very black now. The rain swarmed over us.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Door after door after door, and at last into Sir Roberts country house study. A warm, rich room, where a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth. We devoured our sandwiches, waiting for the rain to cease. Sir Robert estimated that it would stop by eight oclock, when, by moonlight, we might return, ever so reluctantly, to Chatham Forest. I remembered the fallen branch, its spidering touch, and drank both wine and brandy.\n",
            "   “The silence in the forest,” said Sir Robert, finishing his meal. “What murderer could achieve such a silence?”\n",
            "   “An insanely clever man with a series of baited, poisoned traps, with liberal quantities of insecticide, might kill off every bird, every rabbit, every insect,” I said.\n",
            "   “Why should he do that?”\n",
            "   “To convince us that there is a large spider nearby. To perfect his act.”\n",
            "   “We are the only ones who have noticed this silence; the police did not. Why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing?”\n",
            "   “Why is a murderer? you might well ask.”\n",
            "   “I am not convinced.” Sir Robert topped his food with wine. “This creature, with a voracious mouth, has cleansed the forest. With nothing left, he seized the children. The silence, the murders, the prevalence of trapdoor spiders, the large earth balls, it all fits.”\n",
            "   Sir Roberts fingers crawled about the desktop, quite like a washed, manicured spider in itself. He made a cup of his frail hands, held them up.\n",
            "   “At the bottom of a spiders burrow is a dustbin into which drop insect remnants on which the spider has dined. Imagine the dustbin of our Grand Finnegan!”\n",
            "   I imagined. I visioned a Great Legged thing fastened to its dark lid under the forest and a child running, singing in the half-light. A brisk insucked whisk of air, the song cut short, then nothing but an empty glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid, and beneath the dark earth the spider, fiddling, cabling, spinning the stunned child in its silently orchestrating legs.\n",
            "   What would the dustbin of such an incredible spider resemble? What the remnants of many banquets? I shuddered.\n",
            "   “Rains letting up.” Sir Robert nodded his approval. “Back to the forest. Ive mapped the damned place for weeks. All the bodies were found in one half-open glade. Thats where the assassin, if it was a man, arrives! Or where the unnatural silk-spinning, earth-tunneling architect of special doors abides his tomb.”\n",
            "   “Must I hear all this?” I protested.\n",
            "   “Listen more.” Sir Robert downed the last of his burgundy. “The poor childrens prolapsed corpses were found at thirteen-day intervals. Which means that every two weeks our loathsome eight-legged hide-and-seeker must feed. Tonight is the fourteenth night after the last child was found, nothing but skin. Tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh. So! Within the hour, I shall introduce you to Finnegan the great and horrible!”\n",
            "   “All of which,” I said, “makes me want to drink.”\n",
            "   “Here I go.” Sir Robert stepped through one of his Louis the Fourteenth portals. “To find the last and final and most awful door in all my life. You will follow.”\n",
            "   Damn, yes! I followed.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The sun had set, the rain was gone, and the clouds cleared off to show a cold and troubled moon. We moved in our own silence and the silence of the exhausted paths and glades while Sir Robert handed me a small silver pistol.\n",
            "   “Not that that would help. Killing an outsize arachnid is sticky. Hard to know where to fire the first shot. If you miss, therell be no time for a second. Damned things, large or small, move in the instant!”\n",
            "   “Thanks.” I took the weapon. “I need a drink.”\n",
            "   “Done.” Sir Robert handed me a silver brandy flask. “Drink as needed.”\n",
            "   I drank. “What about you?”\n",
            "   “I have my own special flask.” Sir Robert lifted it. “For the right time.”\n",
            "   “Why wait?”\n",
            "   “I must surprise the beast and mustnt be drunk at the encounter. Four seconds before the thing grabs me, I will imbibe of this dear Napoleon stuff, spiced with a rude surprise.\n",
            "   “Surprise?”\n",
            "   “Ah, wait. Youll see. So will this dark thief of life. Now, dear sir, here we part company. I this way, you yonder. Do you mind?”\n",
            "   “Mind when Im scared gutless? Whats that?”\n",
            "   “Here. If I should vanish.” He handed me a sealed letter. “Read it aloud to the constabulary. It will help them locate me and Finnegan, lost and found.”\n",
            "   “Please, no details. I feel like a damned fool following you while Finnegan, if he exists, is underfoot snug and warm, saying, “Ah, those idiots above running about, freezing. I think Ill let them freeze. ““\n",
            "   “One hopes not. Get away now. If we walk together, he wont jump up. Alone, hell peer out the merest crack, glom the scene with a huge bright eye, flip down again, ssst, and one of us gone to darkness.”\n",
            "   “Not me, please. Not me.”\n",
            "   We walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in the half moonlight.\n",
            "   “Are you there?” called Sir Robert from half the world away in leafy dark.\n",
            "   “I wish I werent,” I yelled back.\n",
            "   “Onward!” cried Sir Robert. “Dont lose sight of me. Move closer. Were near on the site. I can intuit, I almost feel—”\n",
            "   As a final cloud shifted, moonlight glowed brilliantly to show Sir Robert waving his arms about like antennae, eyes half shut, gasping with expectation.\n",
            "   “Closer, closer,” I heard him exhale. “Near on. Be still. Perhaps...\n",
            "   He froze in place. There” was something in his aspect that made me want to leap, race, and yank him off the turf he had chosen.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert, oh, God!” I cried. “Run!”\n",
            "   He froze. One hand and arm orchestrated the air, feeling, probing, while his other hand delved, brought forth his silver-coated flask of brandy. He held it high in the moonlight, a toast to doom. Then, afflicted with need, he took one, two, three, my God, four incredible swigs!\n",
            "   Arms out, balancing the wind, tilting his head back, laughing like a boy, he swigged the last of his mysterious drink.\n",
            "   “All right, Finnegan, below and beneath!” he cried. “Come get me!”\n",
            "   He stomped his foot.\n",
            "   Cried out victorious.\n",
            "   And vanished.\n",
            "   It was all over in a second.\n",
            "   A flicker, a blur, a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a whisper, a suction, and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut.\n",
            "   The glade was empty.\n",
            "   “Sir Robert. Quick!”\n",
            "   But there was no one to quicken.\n",
            "   Not thinking that I might be snatched and vanished, I lurched to the spot where Sir Robert had drunk his wild toast.\n",
            "   I stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles, dry grass, and earth.\n",
            "   I must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog, then fell to my knees, fearless, to dig for lids, for tunneled tombs where a voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves, binding and mummifying a thing that had been my friend. This is his final door, I thought insanely, crying the name of my friend.\n",
            "   I found only his pipe, cane, and empty brandy flask, flung down when he had escaped night, life, everything.\n",
            "   Swaying up, I fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering earth, a dumb thing gone stupid as I finished and staggered over his instant graveyard, his locked-in tomb, listening for muffled screams, shrieks, cries, but heard none. I ran in circles, with no ammunition save my weeping shouts. I would have stayed all night, but a downpour of leaves, a great spidering flourish of broken branches, fell to panic and suffer my heart. I fled, still calling his name to a silence lidded by clouds that hid the moon.\n",
            "   At his estate, I beat on the door, wailing, yanking, until I recalled: it opened inward, it was unlocked.\n",
            "   Alone in the library, with only liquor to help me live, I read the letter that Sir Robert had left behind:\n",
            "   \n",
            "   My dear Douglas:\n",
            "   I am old and have seen much but am not mad. Finnegan exists. My chemist had provided me with a sure poison that I will mix in my brandy for our walk. I will drink all. Finnegan, not knowing me as a poisoned morsel will give me a swift invite. Now you see me, now you dont. I will then be the weapon of his death, minutes after my own. I do not think there is another outsize nightmare like him on earth. Once gone, thats the end.\n",
            "   Being old, I am immensely curious. I fear not death, for my physicians tell me that f no accidents kill me, cancer will.\n",
            "   I thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin. But then Id never know where he was or if he really existed. Finnegan would die unseen in his monstrous closet, and I never the wiser. This way, for one victorious moment, I will know. Fear for me. Envy me. Pray for me. Sorry to abandon you without farewells. Dear friend, carry on.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   I folded the letter and wept.\n",
            "   No more was ever heard of him.\n",
            "   Some say Sir Robert killed himself, an actor in his own melodrama, and that one day we shall unearth his brooding, lost, and Gothic body and that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with doors and hinges, and more doors, led him, crazed, to study this one species of spider, and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in history, an insane burrow into which he popped to die, before my eyes, thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible Finnegan.\n",

            "   I can only ask, would a man murder, draw his victims” blood, build an earthen vault? For what motive? Create the finest secret exit in all time? Madness. And what of those large grayish balls of earth supposedly tossed forth from the spiders lair?\n",
            "   Somewhere, Finnegan and Sir Robert lie clasped in a velvet-lined unmarked crypt, deep under. Whether one is the paranoiac alter ego of the other, I cannot say. But the murders have ceased, the rabbits once more rush in Chatham Forest, and its bushes teem with butterflies and birds. It is another spring, and the children run again through a loud glade, no longer silent.\n",

            "THAT WOMAN ON THE LAWN\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Very late at night he heard the weeping on the lawn in front of his house. It was the sound of a woman crying. By its sound he knew it was not a girl or a mature woman, but the crying of someone eighteen or nineteen years old. It went on, then faded and stopped, and again started up, now moving this way or that on the late-summer wind.\n",
            "   He lay in bed listening to it until it made his eyes fill with tears. He turned over, shut his eyes, let the tears fall, but could not stop the sound. Why should a young woman be weeping long after midnight out there?\n",
            "   He sat up and the weeping stopped.\n",
            "   At the window, he looked down. The lawn was empty but covered with dew. There was a trail of footsteps across the lawn to the middle where someone had stood turning, and another trail going off toward the garden around the house.\n",
            "   The moon stood full in the sky and filled the lawn with its light, but there was no more sadness and only the footprints there.\n",
            "   He stepped back from the window, suddenly chilled, and went down to heat and drink a cup of chocolate.\n",
            "   He did not think of the weeping again until dusk the  day, and even then thought that it must be some woman from a house nearby, unhappy with life, perhaps locked out and in need of a place to let her sadness go.\n",
            "   Yet...?\n",
            "   As the twilight deepened, coming home he found himself hurrying from the bus, at a steady pace which astonished him. Why, why all this?\n",
            "   Idiot, he thought. A woman unseen weeps under your window, and here at sunset the  day, you almost run.\n",
            "   Yes, he thought, but her voice!\n",
            "   Was it beautiful, then?\n",
            "   No. Only familiar.\n",
            "   Where had he heard such a voice before, wordless in crying?\n",
            "   Who could he ask, living in an empty house from which his parents had vanished long ago?\n",
            "   He turned in at his front lawn and stood still, his eyes shadowed.\n",
            "   What had he expected? That whoever she was would be waiting here? Was he that lonely that a single voice long after midnight roused all his senses?\n",
            "   No. Simply put: he must know who the crying woman was.\n",
            "   And he was certain she would return tonight as he slept.\n",
            "   He went to bed at eleven, and awoke at three, panicked that he had missed a miracle. Lightning had destroyed a nearby town or an earthquake had shaken half the world to dust, and he had slept through it!\n",
            "   Fool! he thought, and slung back the covers and moved to the window, to see that indeed he had overslept.\n",
            "   For there on the lawn were the delicate footprints.\n",
            "   And he hadnt even heard the weeping!\n",
            "   He would have gone out to kneel in the grass, but at that moment a police car motored slowly by, looking at nothing and the night.\n",
            "   How could he run to prowl, to probe, to touch the grass if that car came by again? What doing? Picking clover blossoms? Weeding dandelions? What, what?\n",
            "   His bones cracked with indecision. He would go down, he would not.\n",
            "   Already the memory of that terrible weeping faded the more he tried to make it clear. If he missed her one more night, the memory itself might be gone.\n",
            "   Behind him, in his room, the alarm clock rang. Damn! he thought. What time did I set it for? He shut off the alarm and sat on his bed, rocking gently, waiting, eyes shut, listening.\n",
            "   The wind shifted. The tree just outside the window whispered and stirred.\n",
            "   He opened his eyes and leaned forward. From far off, coming near, and now down below, the quiet sound of a woman weeping.\n",
            "   She had come back to his lawn and was not forever lost. Be very quiet, he thought.\n",
            "   And the sounds she made came up on the wind through the blowing curtains into his room.\n",
            "   Careful now. Careful but quick.\n",
            "   He moved to the window and looked down.\n",
            "   In the middle of the lawn she stood and wept, her hair long and dark on her shoulders, her face bright with tears.\n",
            "   And there was something in the way her hands trembled at her sides, the way her hair moved quietly in the wind, that shook him so that he almost fell.\n",
            "   He knew her and yet did not. He had seen her before, but had never seen.\n",
            "   Turn your head, he thought.\n",
            "   Almost as if hearing this, the young woman sank to her knees to half kneel on the grass, letting the wind comb her hair, head down and weeping so steadily and bitterly that he wanted to cry out: Oh, no! It kills my heart!\n",
            "   And as if she had heard, quite suddenly her head lifted, her weeping grew less as she looked up at the moon, so that he saw her face.\n",
            "   And it was indeed a face seen somewhere once, but where?\n",
            "   A tear fell. She blinked.\n",
            "   It was like the blinking of a camera and a picture taken.\n",
            "   “God save me!” he whispered. “No!”\n",
            "   He whirled and stumbled toward the closet to seize down an avalanche of boxes and albums. In the dark he scrabbled, then pulled on the closet light, tossed aside six albums until finally, dragging another forth and riffling pages, he gave a cry, stopped, and held a photo close, then turned and moved blindly to the window.\n",
            "   There he stared down at the lawn and then at the photograph, very old, very yellowed with age.\n",
            "   Yes, yes, the same! The image struck his eyes and then his heart. His whole body shook, made an immense pulsation, as he leaned at the album, leaned on the window frame, and almost shouted:\n",
            "   You! How dare you come back! How dare you be young! How dare you be what? A girl untouched, wandering late on my lawn!? You were never that young! Never! Damn, oh, damn your warm blood, damn your wild soul!\n",
            "   But this he did not shout or say.\n",
            "   For something in his eyes, like a beacon, must have flashed.\n",
            "   The crying of the young woman on the lawn stopped.\n",
            "   She looked up.\n",
            "   At which instant the album fell from his fingers, through the burst-wide screen, and down like a dark bird fluttering to strike the earth.\n",
            "   The young man gave a muted cry, whirled, and ran. “No, no!” he cried aloud. “I didnt mean-come back!” He was down the stairs and out on the porch in a matter of seconds. The door slammed behind him like a gunshot. The explosion nailed him to the rail, half down to the lawn, where there was nothing to be seen but footprints. Either way, up the street lay empty sidewalks and shadows under trees. A radio played off in an upstairs window in a house behind trees. A car passed, murmuring, at a far intersection.\n",
            "   “Wait,” he whispered. “Come back. I shouldnt have said—”\n",
            "   He stopped. He had said nothing, but only thought it. But his outrage, his jealousy?\n",
            "   She had felt that. She had somehow heard. And now...?\n",
            "   Shell never come back, he thought. Oh God!\n",
            "   He sat on the porch steps for a while, quietly biting his knuckle.\n",
            "   At three in the morning, in bed, he thought he heard a sigh and soft footsteps in grass, and waited. The photo album lay closed on the floor. Even though it lay shut, he could see and know her face. And it was utterly impossible, utterly insane.\n",
            "   His last thought before sleep was: ghost.\n",
            "   The strangest ghost that ever walked.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone dead.\n",
            "   The ghost of someone who died very old.\n",
            "   But somehow come back not as her old self.\n",
            "   But a ghost that was somehow young.\n",
            "   Werent ghosts always, when they returned, the same age as when they died?\n",
            "   No.\n",
            "   Not this one anyway.\n",
            "   “Why...?” he whispered.\n",
            "   And dream took over the whisper.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One night passed and then another and another, and there was nothing on the lawn but the light of a moon that changed its face from outright stare to half grimace.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   The first night a more than ordinarily casual cat crossed the yard at two a. m.\n",
            "   The second night a dog trotted by, wearing his tongue half out of his mouth like a loosely tied red cravat, smiling at trees.\n",
            "   The third night a spider spent from twelve-twenty-five until four a. m. building a baroque clockface on the air between lawn and trees, which a bird broke in passing at dawn.\n",
            "   He slept most of Sunday and awoke with a fever that was not an illness at dusk.\n",
            "   Late in the twilight of the fifth day, the color of the sky somehow promised her return, as did the way the wind leaned against the trees and the look of the moon when it finally rose to set the scene.\n",
            "   “All right,” he said, half aloud. “Now.” But at midnight, nothing.\n",
            "   “Come on,” he whispered.\n",
            "   One oclock, nothing.\n",
            "   You must, he thought.\n",
            "   No, you will.\n",
            "   He slept for ten minutes and woke suddenly at two-ten, knowing that when he went to the window—\n",
            "   She would be there.\n",
            "   She was.\n",
            "   At first, he didnt see her, and groaned, and then, in the shadow of the great oak far out on the edge of the lawn, he saw something move, and one foot came out, and she took a step and stood very still.\n",
            "   He held his breath, quieted his heart, told himself to turn, walk, and take each step down with precision, numbering them, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, moving in darkness with no rush, six, five, four, and at last one. He opened the front screen door with only a whisper, and was on the porch without frightening what might be out beyond waiting for him.\n",
            "   Quietly, he moved down the porch steps to the edge of the lawn, like one who stands on the rim of a pond. Out in the center of that pond, the young woman stood, trapped like someone on thin ice that might at any moment break and drop her through.\n",
            "   She did not see him. And then... \n",
            "   She did a thing that was a signal. Tonight her hair was fixed in a knot at the back of her head. She lifted her white arms in a gesture and with one touch of her fingers, a touch of snow, loosened her hair.\n",
            "   It fell in a dark banner, to blow and repattern itself across her shoulders, which trembled with their shadows.\n",
            "   The wind stirred her hair in the night and moved it about her face and on her uplifted hands.\n",
            "   The shadows laid down by the moon under every tree leaned as if called by the motion.\n",
            "   The entire world shifted in its sleep.\n",
            "   The wind blew as the young woman waited.\n",
            "   But no footsteps sounded along the white sidewalks. No front doors opened far down the street. No windows were raised. No motion caused front porches to creak and shift.\n",
            "   He took another step out onto the small meadow of night.\n",
            "   “Who are you-?” she gasped, and stepped back. “No, no,” he said softly. “Its all right.” Another trembling had taken over her body. Where before it had been some hope, some anticipation, now it was fear. One hand stopped her hair from blowing; the other half shielded her face.\n",
            "   “Ill stand right here,” he said. “Believe me. “” She waited a long while, staring at him until her shoulders\n",
            "   relaxed and the lines around her mouth vanished. Her whole body sensed the truth of his words.\n",
            "   “I dont understand,” she said.\n",
            "   “I dont either.” “What are you doing here?”\n",
            "   “I dont know.” “What am I doing here?”\n",
            "   “You came to meet someone,” he said.\n",
            "   “Did I?”\n",
            "   The town clock struck three in the morning far away. She listened to it, her face shadowed by the sound.\n",
            "   “But its so late. People dont walk around late on front lawns!”\n",
            "   “They do if they must,” he said.\n",
            "   “But why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe we can find out, if we talk.”\n",
            "   “About what, what?!”\n",
            "   “About why youre here. If we talk long enough, we may know. I know why Im here, of course. I heard you crying.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Im so ashamed.”\n",
            "   “Dont be. Why are people ashamed of tears? I cry often. Then I start laughing. But the crying must come first. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “What a strange man you are.”\n",
            "   Her hand fell away from her hair. Her other hand moved away so her face was illuminated by a small and growing curiosity.\n",
            "   “I thought I was the only one who knew about crying,” she said.\n",
            "   “Everyone thinks that. Its one of those little secrets we keep from each other. Show me a serious man and Ill show you a man who has never wept. Show me a madman and Ill show you a man who dried his tears a long time ago. Go ahead.”\n",
            "   “I think Im done,” she said.\n",
            "   “Any time, start over.”\n",
            "   She burst out a tiny laugh. “Oh, you are strange. Who are you?”\n",
            "   “Well come to that.”\n",
            "   She peered across the lawn at his hands, his face, his mouth, and then at his eyes.\n",
            "   “Oh, I know you. But from where?!”\n",
            "   “That would spoil it. You wouldnt believe, anyway.”\n",
            "   “I would!”\n",
            "   Now it was his turn to laugh quietly. “Youre very young.”\n",
            "   “No, nineteen! Ancient!”\n",
            "   “Girls, by the time they go from twelve to nineteen, are full of years, yes. I dont know; but it must be so. Now, please, why are you out here in the middle of the night?”\n",
            "   “I—” She shut her eyes to think in on it. “Im waiting.”\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   “And Im sad.”\n",
            "   “Its the waiting that makes you sad, yes?”\n",
            "   “I think, no, yes, no.”\n",
            "   “And you dont quite know what youre waiting for?”\n",
            "   “Oh, I wish I could be sure. All of mes waiting. I dont know, all of me. I dont understand. Im impossible!”\n",
            "   “No, youre everyone that ever grew up too fast and wanted too much. I think girls, women, like you have slipped out at night since time began. If it wasnt here in Green Town, it was in Cairo or Alexandria or Rome or Paris in summer, anywhere there was a private place and late hours and no one to see, so they just rose up and out, as if someone had called their name—”\n",
            "   “I was called, yes! Thats it! Someone did call my name! Its true. How did you know? Was it you!”\n",
            "   “No. But someone we both know. Youll know his name when you go back to bed tonight, wherever that is.”\n",
            "   “Why, in that house, behind you,” she said. “Thats my house. I was born in it.”\n",
            "   “Well”-he laughed-“so was I.”\n",
            "   “You? How can that be? Are you sure?”\n",
            "   “Yes. Anyway, you heard someone calling. You had to come out—”\n",
            "   “I did. Many nights now. But, always, no ones here. They must be there, or why would I hear them?”\n",
            "   “One day therell be someone to fit the voice.”\n",
            "   “Oh, dont joke with me!”\n",
            "   “Im not. Believe. There will be. Thats what all those other women heard in other years and places, middle of summer, dead of winter, go out and risk cold, stand warm in snow banks, and listen and look for strange footprints on the midnight snow, and only an old dog trotting by, all smiles. Damn, damn.”\n",
            "   “Oh, yes, damn, damn.” And her smile showed for a moment, even as the moon came out of the clouds and went away. “Isnt it silly?”\n",
            "   “No. Men do the same. They take long walks when theyre sixteen, seventeen. They dont stand on lawns, waiting, no. But, my God, how they walk! Miles and miles from midnight until dawn and come home exhausted and explode and die in bed.”\n",
            "   “What a shame that those who stand and wait and those who walk all night cant—”\n",
            "   “Meet?”\n",
            "   “Yes; dont you think its a shame?”\n",
            "   “They do, finally.”\n",
            "   “Oh, no, I shall never meet anyone. Im old and ugly and terrible and I dont know how many nights Ive heard that voice making me come here and theres nothing and I just want to die.”\n",
            "   “Oh, lovely young girl,” he said gently. “Dont die. The cavalry is on its way. You will be saved.”\n",
            "   There was such certainty in his voice that it made her glance up again, for she had been looking at her hands and her own soul in her hands.\n",
            "   “You know, dont you?” she asked.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",

Very soon, now, a voice will call and when you come out, both of you, your ghost of want and your body with it, there will be a man to go with the voice that calls.”\n",
            "   “Oh, please dont tell me that if it isnt true!” Her voice trembled. Tears flashed again in her eyes. She half raised her arms again in defense.\n",
            "   “I wouldnt dream to hurt you. I only came to tell.” The town clock struck again in the deep morning. “Its late,” she said.\n",
            "   “Very late. Get along, now.” “Is that all youre going to say?” “You dont need to know any more.” The last echoes of the great clock faded.\n",
            "   “How strange,” she murmured. “The ghost of a question, the ghost of an answer.”\n",
            "   “What better ghosts can there be?”\n",
            "   “None that I ever heard of. Were twins.”\n",
            "   “Far nearer than you think.”\n",
            "   She took a step, looked down, and gasped with delight. “Look, oh, look. I can move!”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “What was it you said, boys walk all night, miles and miles?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   “I could go back in, but I cant sleep now. I must walk, too.”\n",
            "   “Do that,” he said gently.\n",
            "   “But where shall I go?”\n",
            "   “Why,” he said, and he suddenly knew. He knew where to send her and was suddenly angry with himself for knowing, angry with her for asking. A burst of jealousy welled in him. He wanted to race down the street to a certain house where a certain young man lived in another year and break the window, burn the roof. And yet, oh, yet, if he did that!?\n",
            "   “Yes?” she said, for he had kept her waiting.\n",
            "   Now, he thought, you must tell her. Theres no escape.\n",
            "   For if you dont tell her, angry fool, you yourself will never be born.\n",
            "   A wild laugh burst from his mouth, a laugh that accepted the entire night and time and all his crazed thinking.\n",
            "   “So you want to know where to go?” he said at last.\n",
            "   \t“Oh, yes!”\n",
            "   He nodded his head. “Up to that corner, four blocks to the right, one block to the left.”\n",
            "   She repeated it quickly. “And the final number?!”\n",
            "   “Eleven Green Park.”\n",
            "   “Oh, thank you, thank you!” She ran a few steps, then stopped, bewildered. Her hands were helpless at her throat. Her mouth trembled. “Silly. I hate to leave.”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “Why, because... Im afraid Ill never see you again!”\n",
            "   “You will. Three years from now.”\n",
            "   “Are you sure?”\n",
            "   “I wont look quite the same. But itll be me. And youll know me forever.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Im glad for that. Your face is familiar. I somehow know you well.”\n",
            "   She began to walk slowly, looking over at him as he stood near the porch of the house.\n",
            "   “Thanks,” she said. “Youve saved my life.”\n",
            "   “And my own along with it.”\n",
            "   The shadows of a tree fell across her face, touched her cheeks, moved in her eyes.\n",
            "   “Oh, Lord! Girls lie in bed nights listing the names for their future children. Silly. Joe. John. Christopher. Samuel. Stephen. And right now, Will.” She touched the gentle rise of her stomach, then lifted her hand out halfway to point to him in the night. “Is your name Will?”\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   Tears absolutely burst from her eyes. He wept with her.\n",
            "   “Oh, thats fine, fine,” she said at last. “I can go now. I wont be out here on the lawn anymore. Thank God, thank you. Good night.”\n",
            "   She went away into the shadows across the lawn and along the sidewalk down the street. At the far corner he saw her turn and wave and walk away.\n",
            "   “Good night,” he said quietly.\n",
            "   I am not born yet, he thought, or she has been dead many years, which is it? which?\n",
            "   The moon sailed into clouds.\n",
            "   The motion touched him to step, walk, go up the porch stairs, wait, look out at the lawn, go inside, shut the door.\n",
            "   A wind shook the trees.\n",
            "   The moon came out again and looked upon a lawn where two sets of footprints, one going one way, one going another in the dew, slowly, slowly, as the night continued, vanished.\n",
            "   By the time the moon had gone down the sky there was only an empty lawn and no sign, and much dew.\n",
            "   The great town clock struck six in the morning. Fire showed in the east. A cock crowed.\n",

            "   \n",
            "   Joshua Enderby awoke in the middle of the night because e felt someones fingers at his throat.\n",
            "   In the rich darkness above him he sensed but could not see his wifes frail, skelatinous weight seated on his chest while she dabbled and clenched tremblingly again and again at his neck.\n",
            "   He opened his eyes wide. He realized what she was trying to do. It was so ridiculous he almost cried out with laughter!\n",
            "   His rickety, jaundiced, eighty-five-year-old wife was trying to strangle him!\n",
            "   She panted forth a rum-and-bitters smell as she perched there, toppling like a drunken moth, tinkering away as if he were a toy. She sighed irritably and her skinny fingers began to swear as she gasped, “Why dont you, oh, why don “t you?”\n",
            "   Why dont I what? he wondered idly, lying there. He swallowed and this faint action of his Adams apple dislodged her feeble clutch. Why dont I die; is that it? he cried silently. He lay another few moments, wondering if shed gain strength enough to do him in. She didnt.\n",
            "   Should he snap on the light to confront her? Wouldnt she look a silly ass, a skinny chicken aloft sidesaddle on her hated husbands amazed body, and him laughing?\n",
            "   Joshua Enderby groaned and yawned. “Missy?”\n",
            "   Her hands froze on his collarbone.\n",
            "   “Will you—” He turned, pretending half sleep. “Will you-please” “-he yawned—” “move to your side—of the bed? Eh? Good girl.”\n",
            "   Missy moved off in the dark. He heard ice tinkle. She was having another shot of rum.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   At noon the  day, enjoying the weather and waiting for luncheon guests to arrive, old Joshua and Missy traded drinks in the garden pavilion. He handed her Dubonnet; she gave him sherry.\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence as both eyed the stuff and hesitated to sip. He handled his glass in such a way that his large white diamond ring sparked and glittered on his palsied hand. Its light made him flinch and at last he gathered his phlegm.\n",
            "   “Missy,” he said. “You havent long to live, you know.” Missy was hidden behind jonquils in a crystal bowl and now peered out at her mummified husband. Both perceived that the others hands shook. She wore a cobalt dress, heavily iced with luncheon jewels, little glittery planets under each ear, a scarlet design for a mouth. The ancient whore of Babylon, he thought dryly.\n",
            "   “How odd, my dear, how very odd,” Missy said with a polite scrape of her voice. “Why, only last night—”\n",
            "   “You were thinking of me?”\n",
            "   “We must talk.”\n",
            "   “Yes, we must.” He leaned like a wax mannequin in his chair. “No rush. But if I do you in, or if you do me in (it matters not which), lets protect each other, yes? Oh, dont look at me in amaze, my dear. I was perfectly aware of your little gallup last night on my ribs, fumbling with my esophagus, feeling the tumblers click, or whatever.”\n",
            "   “Dear me.” Blood rose in Missys powdery cheeks. “Were you awake all during? Im mortified. I think I shall have to go lie down.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense.” Joshua stopped her. “If I die, you should be shielded so no onell accuse you. Same with me, if you die. Why go to all the trouble of trying to-eliminate-each other if it just means a gallows-drop or a french fry.”\n",
            "   “Logical enough,” she agreed.\n",
            "   “I suggest a-a series of mash notes to each other. Umm, lavish displays of sentiment before friends, gifts, et cetera. Ill run up bills for flowers, diamond bracelets. You purchase fine leather wallets and gold-ferruled canes for me.”\n",
            "   “You have a head for things, I must say,” she admitted.\n",
            "   “It will help allay suspicion if we appear madly, anciently in love.”\n",
            "   “You know,” she said tiredly, “it doesnt matter, Joshua, which of us dies first, except that Im very old and would like to do one thing right in my life. Ive always been such a dilettante. Ive never liked you. Loved you, yes, but thats ten million years back. You never were a friend. If it werent for the children—”\n",
            "   “Motives are bilge,” he said. “We are two querulous old pots with nothing to do but kick off, and make a circus of that. But how much better the dying game if we write a few rules, act it neatly, with no one the wiser. How long has this assassination plot of yours been active?”\n",
            "   She beamed. “Remember the opera last week? You slipped from the curb? That car almost nailed you?”\n",
            "   “Good Lord.” He laughed. “I thought someone shoved both of us!” He leaned forward, chuckling. “Okay. When you fell in the bath last month? I greased the tub!”\n",
            "   Unthinkingly, she gasped, drank part of her Dubonnet, then froze.\n",
            "   Reading her mind, he stared at his own drink.\n",
            "   “This isnt poisoned, by any chance?” He sniffed his glass. “Dont be silly,” she replied, touching her Dubonnet with a lizards doubtful tongue. “Theyd find the residue in whats left of your stomach. Just be sure you double-check your shower tonight. I have kited the temperature, which might bring on a seizure.”\n",
            "   “You didnt!” he scoffed.\n",
            "   “Ive thought about it,” she confessed.\n",
            "   The front-door chimes rang, but not with their usual joy, sounding more funereal. Nonsense! Joshua thought. Bosh! thought Missy, then brightened:\n",
            "   “We have forgotten our luncheon guest! Thats the Gowrys! Hes a bore, but be nice! Fix your collar.”\n",
            "   “Its damned tight. Too much starch. One more plot to strangle me?”\n",
            "   “I wish I had thought of that. Double time, now!”\n",
            "   And they marched, arm in arm, with idiot laughter, off to meet the half-forgotten Gowrys.\n",
            "   Cocktails were served. The old relics sat side by side, hands laced like school chums, laughing with weak heartiness at Gowrys dire jokes. They leaned forward to show him their porcelain smiles, saying, “Oh, thats a good one!” loudly, and, softly, sotto voce; to each other: “Thought of anything new?” “Electric razor in your bath?” “Not bad, not bad!”\n",
            "   “And then Pat said to Mike!” cried Mr. Gowry.\n",
            "   From the corner of his mouth Joshua whispered to Missy, “You know, I dislike you with something approaching the colossal proportions of first love. You have taught me mayhem. How?”\n",
            "   “When the teacher is ready, the pupil will arrive,” whispered Missy.\n",
            "   Laughter rose in tumbling, whirling waves. The room was giddy, airy, light. “So Pat says to Mike, do it yourself!” boomed Gowry.\n",
            "   “Oh, ho!” everyone exploded.\n",
            "   “Now, dear.” Missy waved at her ancient husband. “Tell one of your jokes. Oh, but first,” she remembered cleverly, “trot down-cellar, darling, and fetch the brandy.”\n",
            "   Gowry sprang forward with wild courtesy. “I know where it is!”\n",
            "   “Oh, Mr. Gowry, dont!”\n",
            "   Missy gestured frantically.\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry ran from the room.\n",
            "   “Oh, dear, dear me,” cried Missy.\n",
            "   A moment later, Gowry uttered a loud shriek from the basement, followed by a thunderous crash.\n",
            "   Missy hippety-hopped out, only to reappear moments later, her hand clutched to her throat. “Heavens to Betsy,” she wailed. “Come look. I do believe Mr. Gowry has pitched himself straight down the cellar stairs!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The  morning Joshua Enderby shuffled into the house lugging a large green velvet board some five feet by three, on which pistols were clasped in display.\n",
            "   “Here I am!” he shouted.\n",
            "   Missy appeared with a rum Collins in one bracelet-jangly hand, her cane thumping in the other. “Whats that?” she demanded.\n",
            "   “First, hows old Gowry?”\n",
            "   “Broken leg. Wished it had been his vocal cords.”\n",
            "   “Shame about that top cellar step gone loose, eh?” The old man hooked the green velvet board to the wall. “Good thing Gowry lurched for the brandy, not I.”\n",
            "   “Shame.” The wife drank thirstily. “Explain.”\n",
            "   “Im in the antique-gun-collecting business.” He waved at the weapons in their neat leather nests.\n",
            "   “I dont see—”\n",
            "   “With a collection of guns to clean-bang!” He beamed. “Man shoots wife while oiling matchlock garter pistol. Didnt know it was loaded, says weeping spouse.”\n",
            "   “Touche,” she said.\n",
            "   An hour later, while oiling a revolver, he almost blew his brains out.\n",
            "   His wife came thumping in and froze. “Hell. Youre still alive.”\n",
            "   “Loaded, by God!” He lifted the weapon in a trembling hand. “None were loaded! Unless—”\n",
            "   “Unless-?”\n",
            "   He seized three more weapons. “All loaded! You!”\n",
            "   “Me,” she said. “While you ate lunch. I suppose Ill have to give you tea now. Come along.”\n",
            "   He stared at the bullet hole in the wall. “Tea, hell,” he said. “Wheres the gin?!”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was her turn for a shopping spree. “There are ants in the house.” She rattled her full shopping bag and set out ant-paste pots in all the rooms, sprinkled ant powders on windowsills, in his golf bag, and over his gun collection. From other sacks she drew rat poisons, mouse-killers, and bug-exterminators. “A bad summer for roaches.” She distributed these liberally among the foods.\n",
            "   “Thats a double-edged sword,” he observed. “Youll fall on it!”\n",
            "   “Bilge. The victim mustnt choose his demise.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but no violence. I wish a serene face for the coroner.”\n",
            "   “Vanity. Dear Josh, your face will twist like a corkscrew with one heaping teaspoon of Black Leaf Forty in your midnight cocoa!”\n",
            "   “I,” he shot back, “know a recipe that will break you out in a thousand lumps before expiring”\n",
            "   She quieted. “Why, Josh, I wouldnt dream of using Black Leaf Forty.”\n",
            "   He bowed. “I wouldnt dream of using the thousand-lump recipe.”\n",
            "   “Shake,” she said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Their assassins game continued. He bought huge rattraps to hide in the halls. “You run barefoot so: small wounds, large infections!”\n",
            "   She in turn stuck the sofas full of antimacassar pins. Wherever he laid a hand it drew blood. “Ow! Damn!” He sucked his fingers. “Are these Amazon Indian blowgun darts?”\n",
            "   “No. Just plain old rusty lockjaw needles.”\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said.\n",
            "   Though he was aging fast, Joshua Enderby dearly loved to drive. You could see him motoring with feeble wildness up and down the hills of Beverly, mouth gaped, eyes blinking palely.\n",
            "   One afternoon he phoned from Malibu. “Missy? My God, I almost dove from a cliff. My right front wheel flew off on a straightaway!”\n",
            "   “I planned it for a curve!”\n",
            "   “Sorry.”\n",
            "   “Got the idea from Action News. Loosen cars wheel lugs:\n",
            "   tomato surprise.”\n",
            "   “Never mind about careless old me,” he said. “Whats new with you?”\n",
            "   “Rug slipped on the hall stairs. Maid fell on her prat.”\n",
            "   “Poor Lila.”\n",
            "   “I send her everywhere ahead now. She bucketed down like a laundry bag. Lucky shes all fat.”\n",
            "   “Well kill that one between us if were not careful.”\n",
            "   “Do you think? Oh, I do like Lila so.”\n",
            "   “Lay Lila off for a spell. Hire someone new. If we catch them in our crossfire, wont be so sad. Hate to think of Lila smashed under a chandelier or—”\n",
            "   “Chandelier!” Missy shrieked. “You been fiddling with my grandmas Fountainbleu Palace crystal hangings? Listen here, mister. Youre not to touch that chandelier!”\n",
            "   “Promise,” he muttered.\n",
            "   “Good grief! Those lovely crystals! If they fell and missed me, Id hop on one leg to cane you to death, then wake you up and cane you again!”\n",
            "   Slam went the phone.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Joshua Enderby stepped in from the balcony at supper that night. Hed been smoking. He looked at the table. “Wheres your strawberry crumpet?”\n",
            "   “I wasnt hungry. I gave it to the new maid.”\n",
            "   “Idiot!”\n",
            "   She glared. “Dont tell me you poisoned that crumpet, you old S. O. B.?”\n",
            "   There was a crash from the kitchen.\n",
            "   Joshua went to look and returned. “Shes not new any-more,” he said.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   They stashed the new maid in an attic trunk. No one telephoned to ask for her.\n",
            "   “Disappointing,” observed Missy on the seventh day. “I felt certain thered be a tall, cold man with a notebook and another with a camera and flashbulbs flashing. Poor girl was lonelier than we guessed.”\n",
            "   Cocktail parties streamed wildly through the house. It was Missys idea. “So we can pick each other off in a forest of obstacles; moving targets!”\n",
            "   Mr. Gowry, gamely returning to the house, limping after his tumble of some weeks before, joked, laughed, and didnt quite blow his ear off with one of the dueling pistols. Everyone roared but the party broke up early. Gowry vowed never to return.\n",
            "   Then there was a Miss Kummer, who, staying overnight, borrowed Joshuas electric razor and was almost but not quite electrocuted. She left the house rubbing her right underarm. Joshua promptly grew a beard.\n",
            "   Soon after, a Mr. Schlagel vanished. So did a Mr. Smith. The last seen of these unfortunates was at a Saturday night soiree at the Enderbys” mansion.\n",
            "   “Hide-and-seek?” Friends slapped Joshuas back jovially.\n",
            "   “How do you do it? Kill “em with toadstools, plant “em like mushrooms?”\n",
            "   “Grand joke, yes!” chortled Joshua. “No, no, ha, not toadstools, but one got locked in our stand-up fridge. Overnight Eskimo Pie. The other tripped on a croquet hoop. Defenestrated through a greenhouse window.”\n",
            "   “Eskimo Pie, defenestrated!” hooted the party people. “Dear Joshua, you are a card!”\n",
            "   “I speak only the truth,” Joshua protested.\n",
            "   “What wont you think of ?”\n",
            "   “One wonders what did happen to old Schlagel and that rascal Smith.”\n",

            "   “Let me explain. The Eskimo Pie was my dessert. But the croquet hoop? No! Did you spot it in the wrong place, hoping Id pop by and lunge through the greenhouse panes?”\n",
            "   Missy turned to stone; he had touched a nerve.\n",
            "   “Well, now, its time for a wee talk,” he said. “Cancel the parties. One more victim and sirens will announce the arrival of the law.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” Missy agreed. “Our target practice seems to wind up in ricochet. About that croquet hoop. You always take midnight greenhouse walks. Why was that damn fool Schlagel stumbling about out there at two a. m.? Dumb ox. Is he still under the compost?”\n",
            "   “Until I stash him with he-who-is-frozen.”\n",
            "   “Dear, dear. No more parties.”\n",
            "   “Just you, me and-ah-the chandelier?”\n",
            "   “Ah, no. Ive hid the stepladder so you cant climb!”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   That night by the fireplace, he poured a few glasses of their best port. While he was out of the room, answering the telephone, she dropped a little white powder in her own glass.\n",
            "   “Hate this,” she murmured. “Terribly unoriginal. But there wont be an inquest. He looked long dead before he died, theyll say as they shut the lid.” And she added a touch more lethal stuff to her port just as he wandered in to sit and pluck up his glass. He . eyed it and fixed his wife a grin. “Ah, no, no, you dont!”\n",
            "   “Dont what?” she said, all innocence.\n",
            "   The fire crackled warmly, gently on the hearth. The mantel clock ticked.\n",

            "   “Surely you dont think I poisoned your drink while you were out?”\n",
            "   “Trite. Banal. But possible.”\n",

            "   He looked surprised but traded glasses.\n",
            "   “Heres not looking at you!” both said, and laughed.\n",
            "   They drank with mysterious smiles.\n",
            "   And then they sat with immense satisfaction in their easy chairs, the firelight glimmering on their ghost-pale faces, letting the port warm their almost spidery veins. He stuck his legs out and held one hand to the fire. “Ah.” He sighed.\n",
            "   “Nothing, nothing quite like port!”\n",
            "   She leaned her small gray head back, dozing, gumming her red-sticky mouth, and glancing at him with half-secretive, lazy eyes. “Poor Lila,” she murmured.\n",
            "   “Yes,” he murmured. “Lila. Poor.”\n",
            "   The fire popped and she at last added, “Poor Mr. Schlagel.”\n",
            "   “Yes.” He drowsed. “Poor Schlagel. Dont forget Smith.”\n",
            "   “And you, old man,” she said finally, slowly, slyly. “How do you feel?”\n",
            "   “Sleepy.”\n",
            "   “Very sleepy?”\n",
            "   “Un-huh.” He studied her with bright eyes. “And, my dear, what about you?”\n",
            "   “Sleepy,” she said behind closed eyes. Then they popped wide. “Why all these questions?”\n",
            "   “Indeed,” he said, stirring alert. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Oh, well, because...” She examined her little black shoe moving in a low rhythm a long way off below her knee. “I think, or perhaps imagine, I have just destroyed your digestive and nervous systems.”\n",
            "   For the moment he was drowsily content and examined the warm fire and listened to the clock tick. “What you mean is that you have just poisoned me?” He dreamed the words. “You what!?” He jumped as all the air gusted from his body. The port glass shattered on the floor.\n",
            "   She leaned forward like a fortune-teller eagerly predicting futures.\n",
            "   “I cleverly poisoned my own drink and knew that youd ask to trade off, so you felt safe. And we did!” Her laugh tinkled.\n",
            "   He fell back in his chair, clutching at his face to stop the wild swiveling of his eyes. Then suddenly he remembered something and let out an incredible explosion of laughter.\n",
            "   “Why,” cried Missy, “why are you laughing?”\n",
            "   “Because,” he gasped, tears streaming down his cheeks, his mouth grinning horribly, “I poisoned my drink! and hoped for an excuse to change with you!”\n",
            "   “Oh, dear,” she cried, no longer smiling. “How stupid of us. Why didnt I guess?”\n",
            "   “Because both of us are much too clever by far!” And he lay back, chortling.\n",
            "   “Oh, the mortification, the embarrassment, I feel stark naked and hate myself!”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he husked. “Think instead how much you still hate me.”\n",
            "   “With all my withered heart and soul. You?”\n",
            "   “No deathbed forgiveness here, old lily-white iron-maiden wife 0 mine. Cheerio,” he added faintly, far away.\n",
            "   “If you think Ill say “Cheerio” back, youre crazed,” she whispered, her head rolling to one side, her eyes clamped,\n",
            "   her mouth gone loose around the words. “But what the hell. Cheer—”\n",
            "   At which her breath ceased and the fire burned to ashes as the clock ticked and ticked in the quiet room.\n",
            "   Friends found them strewn in their library chairs the  day, both looking more than usually pleased with their situation.\n",

            "   My wife and I were seated at a Saturday night performance, it was summer and warm, the audience melting in weather and conviviality. All around I saw married and engaged couples delighted and then alarmed by the comic opera of their lives which was being shown in immense symbol onstage.\n",
            "   A woman was sawed in half. How the husbands in the audience smiled.\n",
            "   A woman in a cabinet vanished. A bearded magician wept for her in despair. Then, at the tip-top of the balcony, she appeared, waving a white-powdered hand, infinitely beautiful, unattainable, far away.\n",
            "   How the wives grinned their cat grins!\n",
            "   “Look at them!” I said to my wife.\n",
            "   A woman floated in midair... a goddess born in all mens minds by their own true love. Let not her dainty feet touch earth. Keep her on that invisible pedestal. Watch it! God, dont tell me how its done, anyone! Ah, look at her float, and dream.\n",
            "   And what was that man who spun plates, globes, stars, torches, his elbows twirling hoops, his nose balancing a blue feather, sweating everything at once! What, I asked myself, but the commuter husband, lover, worker, the quick luncher, juggling hour, Benzedrine, Nembutal, bank balances, and budgets?\n",
            "   Obviously, none of us had come to escape the world outside, but rather to have it tossed back at us in more easily digested forms, brighter, cleaner, quicker, neater; a spectacle both heartening and melancholy.\n",
            "   Who in life has not seen a woman disappear?\n",
            "   There, on the black, plush stage, women, mysteries of talc and rose petal, vanished. Cream alabaster statues, sculptures of summer lily and fresh rain melted to dreams, and the dreams became empty mirrors even as the magician reached hungrily to seize them.\n",
            "   From cabinets and nests of boxes, from flung sea-nets, shattering like porcelain as the conjurer fired his gun, the women vanished.\n",
            "   Symbolic, I thought. Why do magicians point pistols at lovely assistants, unless through some secret pact with the male subconscious?\n",

            "   I looked to see if she was joking. In the dark, her dim mouth seemed to be smiling, but the quality of that smile was lost to me.\n",

            "   There, with no great fanfare, no swirl of cape, no bow, only the most condescending tilt of her head, and the faintest elevation of her left eyebrow, stood Miss Quick.\n",
            "   I thought it was a dog act, when she snapped her fingers.\n",

            "   It was obvious instantly that Miss Quick was the same woman who had been vanishing all evening.\n",
            "   Budget show, I thought; everyone doubles in brass. I dont like her.\n",

            "   “Am I talking out loud again?”\n",
            "   But really, Miss Quick provoked me. For she looked as if she had gone backstage, shrugged on a rumpled tweed walking suit, one size too large, gravy-spotted and grass-stained, and then purposely rumpled her hair, painted her lipstick askew, and was on the point of exiting the stage door when someone cried, “Youre on!”\n",
            "   So here she was now, in her practical shoes, her nose shiny, her hands in motion but her face immobile, getting it over with .\n",

            "   The audience waited.\n",
            "   “Thats all! Acts over! Back to your seats!”\n",
            "   Snap! went her plain fingers.\n",
            "   The men, dismayed, sheepishly peering at each other, ambled off. She let them stumble half down the stairs into darkness, then yawned:\n",
            "   “Havent you forgotten something?”\n",
            "   Eagerly, they turned.\n",
            "   “Here.”\n",
            "   With a smile like the very driest wine, she lazily unwedged a wallet from one of her pockets. She removed another wallet from within her coat. Followed by a third, a fourth, a fifth! Ten wallets in all!\n",
            "   She held them forth, like biscuits, to good beasts. The men blinked. No, those were not their wallets! They had been onstage for only an instant. She had mingled with them only in passing. It was all a joke. Surely she was offering them brand-new wallets, compliments of the show!\n",
            "   But now the men began feeling themselves, like sculptures finding unseen flaws in old, hastily flung together armatures. Their mouths gaped, their hands grew more frantic, slapping their chest-pockets, digging their pockets.\n",
            "   All the while Miss Quick ignored them to calmly sort their wallets like the morning mail.\n",
            "   It was at this precise moment I noticed the man on the far right end of the line, half on the stage. I lifted my opera glasses. I looked once. I looked twice.\n",
            "   “Well,” I said lightly. “There seems to be a man there who somewhat resembles me.”\n",
            "   “Oh?” said my wife.\n",
            "   I handed her the glasses, casually. “Far right.”\n",
            "   “Its not like you,” said my wife. “Its you!”\n",
            "   “Well, almost,” I said modestly.\n",
            "   The fellow was nice-looking. It was hardly cricket to look thus upon yourself and pronounce favorable verdicts. Simultaneously, I had grown quite cold. I took back the opera glasses and nodded, fascinated. “Crew cut. Horn-rimmed glasses. Pink complexion. Blue eyes—”\n",
            "   “Your absolute twin!” cried my wife.\n",
            "   And this was true. And it was strange, sitting there, watching myself onstage.\n",
            "   “No, no, no,” I kept whispering.\n",
            "   But yet, what my mind refused, my eye accepted. Arent there two billion people in this world? Yes! All different snowflakes, no two the same! But now here, delivered into my gaze, endangering my ego and my complacency, here was a casting from the same absolutes, the identical mold.\n",
            "   Should I believe, disbelieve, feel proud, or run scared? For here I stood witness to the forgetfulness of God.\n",
            "   “I dont think,” said God, “Ive made one like this before.”\n",
            "   But, I thought, entranced, delighted, alarmed: God errs.\n",
            "   Flashes from old psychology books lit my mind.\n",
            "   Heredity. Environment.\n",
            "   “Smith! Jones! Helstrom!”\n",
            "   Onstage, in bland drill-sergeant tones, Miss Quick called roll and handed back the stolen goods.\n",
            "   You borrow your body from all your forebears, I thought. Heredity.\n",
            "   But isnt the body also an environment?\n",
            "   “Winters!”\n",
            "   Environment, they say, surrounds you. Well, doesnt the body surround, with its lakes, its architectures of bone, its overabundances, or wastelands of soul? Does not what is seen in passing window-mirrors, a face either serene snowfalls or a pitted abyss, the hands like swans or sparrows, the feet anvils or hummingbirds, the body a lumpy wheat-sack or a summer fern, do these not, seen, paint the mind, set the image, shape the brain and psyche like clay? They do!\n",
            "   “Bidwell! Rogers!”\n",
            "   Well, then, trapped in the same environmental flesh, how fared this stranger onstage?\n",
            "   In the old fashion, I wanted to leap to my feet and call, “What oclock is it?”\n",
            "   And he, like the town crier passing late with my face, might half mournfully reply, “Nine oclock, and alls well\n",
            "   But was all well with him?\n",
            "   Question: did those horn-rims cover a myopia not only of light but of spirit?\n",
            "   Question: was the slight obesity pressed to his skeleton symbolic of a similar gathering of tissue in his head?\n",
            "   In sum, did his soul go north while mine went south, the same flesh cloaking us but our minds reacting, one winter, one summer?\n",
            "   “My God,” I said, half aloud. “Suppose were absolutely identical!”\n",
            "   “Shh!” said a woman behind me.\n",
            "   I swallowed hard.\n",
            "   Suppose, I thought, he is a chain-smoker, light sleeper, overeater, manic-depressive, glib talker, deep/shallow thinker, flesh fancier...\n",
            "   No one with that body, that face, could be otherwise. Even our names must be similar.\n",
            "   Our names!\n",
            "   “...I... bl... er...” .\n",
            "   Miss Quick spoke his!\n",
            "   Someone coughed. I missed it.\n",
            "   Perhaps shed repeat it. But no, he, my twin, moved forward. Damn! He stumbled! The audience laughed.\n",
            "   I focused my binoculars swiftly.\n",
            "   My twin stood quietly, center stage now, his wallet returned to his fumbling hands.\n",
            "   “Stand straight,” I whispered. “Dont slouch.”\n",
            "   “Shh!” said my wife.\n",
            "   I squared my own shoulders, secretly.\n",
            "   I never knew I looked that fine, I thought, cramming the glasses to my eyes. Surely my nostrils arent that thinly made, the true aristocrat. Is my skin that fresh and handsome, my chin that firm?\n",
            "   I blushed, in silence.\n",
            "   After all, if my wife said that was me, accept it! The lamplight of pure intelligence shone softly from every pore of his face.\n",
            "   “The glasses.” My wife nudged me.\n",
            "   Reluctantly I gave them up.\n",
            "   She trained the glasses rigidly, not on the man, but now on Miss Quick, who was busy cajoling, flirting, and repicking the pockets of the nearest men. On occasion my wife broke into a series of little satisfied snorts and giggles.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Miss Quick was, indeed, the goddess Shiva.\n",
            "   If I saw two hands, I saw nine. Her hands, an aviary, flew, rustled, tapped, soared, petted, whirled, tickled as Miss Quick, her face blank, swarmed coldly over her victims; touched without touching.\n",
            "   “Whats in this pocket? And this? And here?”\n",
            "   She shook their vests, pinched their lapels, jingled their trousers: money rang. She punched them lightly with a vindictive forefinger, ringing totals on cash registers. She unplucked coat buttons with mannish yet fragile motions, gave wallets back, sneaked them away. She thrust them, took them, stole them again, while peeling money to count it behind the mens backs, then snatched their watches while\n",
            "   holding their hands.\n",
            "   She trapped a live doctor now!\n",

            "   “Temperature!” she cried. “One hundred ten!”\n",
            "   She closed her eyes and gave an insincere shake of her hips.\n",

            "   “Wheres your tie?”\n",
            "   They clapped their hands to their empty collars.\n",
            "   She plucked their ties from nowhere, tossed them back.\n",
            "   She was a magnet that invisibly drew good-luck charms, saints” medals, Roman coins, theater stubs, handkerchiefs, stickpins, while the audience ran riot, convulsed as these rabbit men stood peeled of all prides and protections.\n",
            "   Hold your hip pocket, she vacuumed your vest. Clutch your vest, she jackpotted your trousers. Blithely bored, firm but evanescent, she convinced you you missed nothing, until she extracted it, with faint loathing, from her own tweeds moments later.\n",
            "   “Whats this?!” She held up a letter. “Dear Helen: Last night with you—”\n",
            "   A furious blush as the victim tussled with Miss Quick, snatched the letter, stowed it away. But a moment later, the letter was restolen and reread aloud: “Dear Helen: Last night—”\n",
            "   So the battle raged. One woman. Ten men.\n",
            "   She kissed one, stole his belt.\n",

            "   Their men, shocked, joined in.\n",
            "   What a magnificent bully, Miss Quick! How she spanked her dear, idiot-grinning, carry-on-somehow men turned boys as she spun them like cigar-store Indians, knocked them with her brontosaur hip, leaned on them like barber-poles, calling each one cute or lovely or handsome.\n",
            "   This night, I thought, is lunatic! All about me, wives, hilarious with contempt, hysterical at being so shabbily revealed in their national pastimes, gagged for air. Their husbands sat stunned, as if a war were over that had not been declared, fought and lost before they could move. Each, nearby, had the terrible look of a man who fears his throat is cut, and that a sneeze would fill the aisle with heads .\n",
            "   Quickly! I thought. Do something!\n",
            "   “You, you onstage, my twin, dodge! Escape!”\n",
            "   And she was coming at him!\n",

            "   If I shouted this, or merely ground it to powder in my teeth, I dont recall, for all the men froze as Miss Quick seized my twin by the hand.\n",
            "   “Careful!” I whispered.\n",
            "   Too late. His watch was gone. He didnt know it. Your watch is gone! I thought. He doesnt know what time it is! I thought.\n",
            "   Miss Quick stroked his lapel. Back off! I warned myself.\n",
            "   Too late. His forty-dollar pen was gone. He didnt know it. She tweaked his nose. He smiled. Idiot! There went his wallet. Not your nose, fool, your coat!\n",
            "   “Padded?” She pinched his shoulder. He looked at his right arm. No! I cried silently, for now she had the letters out of his left coat pocket. She planted a red kiss on his brow and backed off with everything else he had on him, coins, identification, a package of chocolates which she ate, greedily. Use the sense God gave a cow! I shouted behind my face. Blind! See what shes doing!\n",
            "   She whirled him round, measured him, and said, “This yours?” and returned his tie.\n",
            "   My wife was hysterical. She still held the glasses fixed on every nuance and vibration of loss and deprivation on the poor idiots face. Her mouth was spoiled with triumph.\n",
            "   My God! I cried in the uproar. Get off the stage! I yelled within, wishing I could really yell it. At least get out while you have some pride!\n",
            "   The laughter had erupted a volcano in the theater, high and rumbling and dark. The dim grotto seemed lit with unhealthy fever, an incandescence. My twin wanted to break off, like one of Pavlovs dogs, too many bells on too many days: no reward, no food. His eyes were glazed with his insane predicament.\n",
            "   Fall! Jump in the pit! Crawl away! I thought.\n",
            "   The orchestra sawed at destiny with violins and Valkyrian trumpets in full flood.\n",

            "   She threw the shirt in the air. As it fell, so did his pants As his pants fell, unbelted, so did the theater. An avalanche of shock soared to bang the rafters and roll over us in echoes a thundering hilarity.\n",
            "   The curtain fell.\n",
            "   We sat, covered with unseen rubble. Drained of blood, buried in one upheaval after another, degraded and autopsied and, minus eulogy, tossed into a mass grave, we men took a minute to stare at that dropped curtain, behind which hid the pickpocket and her victims, behind which a man quickly hoisted his trousers up his spindly legs.\n",
            "   A burst of applause, a prolonged tide on a dark shore. Miss Quick did not appear to bow. She did not need to. She was standing behind the curtain. I could feel her there, no smile, no expression. Standing, coldly estimating the caliber of the applause, comparing it to the metered remembrances of other nights.\n",
            "   I jumped up in an absolute rage. I had, after all, failed myself. When I should have ducked, I bobbed; when I should have backed off, I ran in. What an ass!\n",
            "   “What a fine show!” said my wife as we milled through the departing audience.\n",
            "   “Fine!” I cried.\n",
            "   “Didnt you like it?”\n",
            "   “All except the pickpocket. Obvious act, overdone, no subtlety,” I said, lighting a cigarette.\n",
            "   “She was a whiz!”\n",
            "   “This way.” I steered my wife toward the stage door.\n",
            "   “Of course,” said my wife blandly, “that man, the one who looks like you, he was a plant. They call them shills, dont they? Paid by the management to pretend to be part of the audience?”\n",
            "   “No man would take money for a spectacle like that,” I said. “No, he was just some boob who didnt know how to be careful.”\n",
            "   “What are we doing back here?”\n",
            "   Blinking around, we found we were backstage.\n",
            "   Perhaps I wished to stride up to my twin, shouting, “Half-baked ox! Insulter of all men! Play a flute: you dance. Tickle your chin: you jump like a puppet! Jerk!”\n",
            "   The truth was, of course, I must see my twin close-up, confront the traitor and see where his true flesh differed from mine. After all, wouldnt I have done better in his place?!\n",
            "   The backstage was lit in blooms and isolated flushes, now bright, now dark, where the other magicians stood chatting. And there, there was Miss Quick!\n",
            "   And there, smiling, was my twin!\n",
            "   “You did fine, Charlie,” said Miss Quick.\n",
            "   My twins name was Charlie. Stupid name.\n",
            "   Charlie patted Miss Quicks cheek. “You did fine, maam!”\n",
            "   God, it was true! A shill, a confederate. Paid what? Five, ten dollars for letting his shirt be torn oft, letting his pants drop with his pride? What a turncoat, traitor!\n",
            "   I stood, glaring.\n",
            "   He glanced up.\n",
            "   Perhaps he saw me.\n",
            "   Perhaps some bit of my rage and impacted sorrow reached him.\n",
            "   He held my gaze for only a moment, his mouth wide, as if he had just seen an old school chum. But, not remembering my name, could not call out, so let the moment pass.\n",
            "   He saw my rage. His face paled. His smile died. He glanced quickly away. He did not look up again, but stood pretending to listen to Miss Quick, who was laughing and talking with the other magicians.\n",
            "   I stared at him and stared again. Sweat oiled his face. My hate melted. My temper cooled. I saw his profile clearly, his chin, eyes, nose, hairline; I memorized it all. Then I heard someone say:\n",
            "   “It was a fine show!”\n",
            "   My wife, moving forward, shook the hand of the pickpocketing beast.\n",
            "   On the street, I said, “Well, Im satisfied.”\n",
            "   “About what?” asked my wife.\n",
            "   “He doesnt look like me at all. Chins too sharp. Nose is smaller. Lower lip isnt full enough. Too much eyebrow. Onstage, far oft, had me going. But close up, no, no. It was the crew cut and horn-rims fooled us. Anyone could have horn-rims and a crew cut.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” my wife agreed, “anyone.”\n",
            "   As she climbed into our car, I could not help but admire her long, lovely legs.\n",
            "   Driving off, I thought I glimpsed that familiar face in the passing crowd. The face, however, was watching me. I wasnt sure. Resemblances, I now knew, are superficial.\n",
            "   The face vanished in the crowd.\n",
            "   “Ill never forget,” said my wife, “when his pants-fell!” I drove very fast, then drove very slow, all the way home.\n",

            "   Good evening. Welcome. I see you have my invitation in your hands. Decided to be brave, did you? Fine. Here we are Grab onto this.”\n",
            "   The tall, handsome stranger with the heavenly eyes and the impossibly blond hair handed me a wineglass.\n",
            "   “Clean your palate,” he said.\n",
            "   I took the glass and read the label on the bottle he held in his left hand. Bordeaux, it read. St. Emilion.\n",
            "   “Go on,” said my host. “Its not poison. May I sit? And might you drink?”\n",
            "   “I might,” I sipped, shut my eyes, and smiled. “Youre a connoisseur. This is the best Ive had in years. But why this wine and why the invitation? What am I doing here at Grays Anatomy Bar and Grill?”\n",
            "   My host sat and filled his own glass. “I am doing a favor to myself. This is a great night, perhaps for both of us. Greater than Christmas or Halloween.” His lizard tongue darted into his wine to vanish back into his contentment. “We celebrate my being honored, at last becoming—”\n",
            "   He exhaled it all out:\n",
            "   “Becoming,” he said, “a friend to Dorian! Dorians friend. Me!”\n",
            "   “Ah.” I laughed. “That explains the name of this place, then? Does Dorian own Grays Anatomy?”\n",
            "   “More! Inspires and rules over it. And deservedly so.”\n",
            "   “You make it sound as if being a friend to Dorian is the most important thing in the world.”\n",
            "   “No! In life! In all of life.” He rocked back and forth, drunk not from the wine but from some inner joy. “Guess.”\n",
            "   “At what?”\n",
            "   “How old I am!”\n",
            "   “You look to be twenty-nine at the most.”\n",
            "   “Twenty-nine. What a lovely sound. Not thirty, forty, or fifty, but—”\n",
            "   I said, “I hope youre not going to ask what sign I was born under. I usually leave when people ask that. I was born on the cusp, August, 1920.” I pretended to half rise. He pressed a gentle hand to my lapel.\n",
            "   “No, no, dear boy-you dont understand. Look here. And here.” He touched under his eyes and then around his neck. “Look for wrinkles.”\n",
            "   “But you have none,” I said.\n",
            "   “How observant. None. And that is why I have become this very night a fresh, new, stunningly handsome friend to Dorian.”\n",
            "   “I still dont see the connection.”\n",
            "   “Look at the backs of my hands.” He showed his wrists. “No liver spots. I am not turning to rust. I repeat the question, how old am I?”\n",
            "   I swirled the wine in my glass and studied his reflection in the swirl.\n",
            "   “Sixty?” I guessed. “Seventy?”\n",
            "   “Good God!” He fell back in his chair, astonished. “How did you know?”\n",
            "   “Word association. Youve been rattling on about Dorian. I know my Oscar Wilde, I know my Dorian Gray, which means you, sir, have a portrait of yourself stashed in an attic aging while you yourself, drinking old wine, stay young.”\n",
            "   “No, no.” The handsome stranger leaned forward. “Not stayed young. Became young. I was old, very old, and it took a year, but the clock went back and after a year of playing at it, I achieved what I set out for.”\n",
            "   “Twenty-nine was your target?”\n",
            "   “How clever you are!”\n",
            "   “And once you became twenty-nine you were fully elected as—”\n",
            "   “A Friend to Dorian! Bulls-eye! But there is no portrait, no attic, no staying young. Its becoming young agains the ticket.”\n",
            "   “Im still puzzled!”\n",
            "   “Child of my heart, you might possibly be another Friend. Come along. Before the greatest revelation, let me show you the far end of the room and some doors.”\n",
            "   He seized my hand. “Bring your wine. Youll need it!” He hustled me along through the tables in a swiftly filling room of mostly middle-aged and some fairly young men, and a few smoke-exhaling ladies. I jogged along, staring back at the EXIT as if my future life were there.\n",
            "   Before us stood a golden door.\n",
            "   “And behind the door?” I asked.\n",
            "   “What always lies behind any golden door?” my host responded. “Touch.”\n",
            "   I reached out to print the door with my thumb.\n",
            "   “What do you feel?” my host inquired.\n",
            "   “Youngness, youth, beauty.” I touched again. “All the springtimes that ever were or ever will be.”\n",
            "   “Jeez, the mans a poet. Push.”\n",
            "   We pushed and the golden door swung soundlessly wide.\n",
            "   “Is this where Dorian is?”\n",
            "   “No, no, only his students, his disciples, his almost Friends. Feast your eyes.”\n",
            "   I did as I was told and saw, at the longest bar in the world, a line of men, a lineage of young men, reflecting and re-reflecting each other as in a fabled mirror maze, that illusion seen where mirrors face each other and you find yourself repeated to infinity, large, small, very small, smallest, GONE! The young men were all staring down the long bar at us and then, as if unable to pull their gaze away, at themselves. You could almost hear their cries of appreciation. And with each cry, they grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful...\n",
            "   I gazed upon a tapestry of beauty, a golden phalanx freshly out of the Elysian fields and hills. The gates of mythology swung wide and Apollo and his demi-Apollos glided forth, each more beautiful than the last.\n",
            "   I must have gasped. I heard my host inhale as if he drank my wine.\n",
            "   “Yes, arent they,” he said.\n",
            "   “Come,” whispered my new friend. “Run the gauntlet. Dont linger; you may find tiger-tears on your sleeve and blood rising. Now.”\n",
            "   And he glided, he undulated, me along on his soundless tuxedo slippers, his fingers a pale touch on my elbow, his breath a flower scent too near. I heard myself say:\n",
            "   “Its been written that H. G. Wells attracted women with his breath, which smelled of honey. Then I learned that such breath comes with illness.”\n",
            "   “How clever. Do I smell of hospitals and medicines?”\n",
            "   “I didnt mean—”\n",
            "   “Quickly. Youre rare meat in the zoo. Hup, two, three!”\n",
            "   “Hold on,” I said, breathless not from walking fast but from perceiving quickly. “This man, and the , and the one after that—”\n",
            "   “Yes?!”\n",
            "   “My God,” I said, “theyre almost all the same, look-alikes!”\n",
            "   “Bulls-eye, half true! And the  and the  after that, as far behind as we have gone, as far ahead as we might go. All twenty-nine years old, all golden tan, all six feet tall, white of teeth, bright of eye. Each different but beautiful, like me!”\n",
            "   I glanced at him and saw what I saw around me. Similar but different beauties. So much youngness I was stunned.\n",
            "   “Isnt it time you told me your name?”\n",
            "   “Dorian.”\n",
            "   “But you said you were his Friend.”\n",
            "   “I am. They are. But we all share his name. This chap here. And the . Oh, once we had commoner names. Smith and Jones. Harry and Phil. Jimmy and Jake. But then we signed up to become Friends.”\n",
            "   “Is that why I was invited? To sign up?”\n",
            "   “I saw you in a bar across town a year ago, made queries. A year later, you look the proper age—”\n",
            "   “Proper-?”\n",
            "   “Well, arent you? Just leaving sixty-nine, arriving at seventy?”\n",
            "   “Well. “”\n",
            "   “My God! Are you happy being seventy?”\n",
            "   “Itll do. “”\n",
            "   “Do? Wouldnt you like to be really happy, steal some wild oats? Sow them?!”\n",
            "   “That times over.”\n",
            "   “Its not. I asked and you came, curious.\n",
            "   “Curious about what?”\n",
            "   “This.” He bared me his neck again and flexed his pale white wrists. “And all those!” He waved at the fine faces as we passed. “Dorians sons. Dont you want to be gloriously wild and young like them?”\n",
            "   “How can I decide?”\n",
            "   “Lord, youve thought of it all night for years. Soon you could be part of this!”\n",
            "   We had reached the far end of the line of men with bronzed faces, white teeth, and breath like H. G. Wells” scent of honey... \n",
            "   “Arent you tempted?” he pursued. “Will you refuse—”\n",
            "   “Immortality?”\n",
            "   “No! To live the  twenty years, die at ninety, and look twenty-nine in the damn tomb! In the mirror over there-what do you see?”\n",
            "   “An old goat among ten dozen fauns.”\n",
            "   “Yes!”\n",
            "   “Where do I sign up?” I laughed.\n",
            "   “Do you accept?”\n",
            "   “No, I need more facts.”\n",
            "   “Damn! Heres the second door. Get in!”\n",
            "   He swung wide a door, more golden than the first, shoved me, followed, and slammed the door. I stared at darkness.\n",
            "   “Whats this?” I whispered.\n",
            "   “Dorians Gym, of course. If you work out here all year, hour by hour, day by day, you get younger.”\n",
            "   “Thats some gym,” I observed, trying to adjust my eyes to the dim areas beyond where shadows tumbled, and voices rustled and whispered. “Ive heard of gyms that help keep, not make, you young... Now tell me...\n",
            "   “I read your mind. For every old man that became young in there at the bar, is there an attic portrait?”\n",
            "   “Well, is there?”\n",
            "   “No! Theres only Dorian.”\n",
            "   “A single person? Who grows old for all of you?”\n",
            "   “Touche”! Behold his gym!”\n",
            "   I gazed off into a vast high arena where a hundred shadows stirred and moaned like a tide on a terrible shore.\n",
            "   “I think its time to leave,” I said.\n",
            "   “Nonsense. Come. No one will see you. Theyre all... busy. I am Moses,” said the sweet breath at my elbow. “And I hereby tell the Red Sea to part!”\n",
            "   And we moved along a path between two tides, each shadowed, each more terrifying with its gasps, its cries, its slip-pages of flesh, its slapping like waves, its repeated whispers for more, more, ah, God, more!\n",
            "   I ran, but my host grabbed on. “Look right, left, now right again!”\n",
            "   There must have been a hundred, two hundred animals, beasts, no, men wrestling, leaping, falling, rolling in darkness. It was a sea of flesh, undulant, a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats, a glistening of skin, flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes, spun on leather horses, or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of lamentations and muffled cries. I stared across an ocean of rising and falling shapes. My ears were scorched by their bestial moans.\n",
            "   “What, my God,” I exclaimed, “does it all mean?”\n",
            "   “There. See.”\n",
            "   And above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window, forty feet wide and ten feet tall, and behind that cold glass Something watching, savoring, alert, one vast stare.\n",
            "   And over all there was the suction of a great breath, a vast inhalation which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible need. As the shadows tumbled and writhed, this inhalation tugged at them and the raw air in my nostrils. Somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked in darkness but did not exhale. There were long pauses as the shadows flailed and fell, and then another savoring inhalation. It swallowed breath. In, in, always in, devouring the sweaty air, hungering the passions.\n",
            "   And the shadows were pulled, I was pulled, toward that vast glass eye, that immense window behind which a shapeless Something stared to dine on gymnasium airs.\n",
            "   “Dorian?” I guessed.\n",
            "   “Come meet him.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but...” I watched the wild, convulsive shadows. “What are they doing?”\n",
            "   “Go find out. Afraid? Cowards never live. So!”\n",
            "   He swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive, I could not feel, for suddenly I lurched into a hothouse as the door slammed and was locked by my blond young friend. “Ready?”\n",
            "   “Lord, I must go home!”\n",
            "   “Not until you meet,” said my host, “him.”\n",
            "   He pointed. At first I could see nothing. The lights were dim and the place, like the gymnasium, was mostly shadow. I smelled jungle greens. The air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes. I smelled papaya and mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an unseen tide. But the tide was there with that immense inhaled breathing that rose and was quiet and began again.\n",
            "   “I see no one,” I said.\n",
            "   “Let your eyes adjust. Wait.”\n",
            "   I waited. I watched.\n",
            "   There were no chairs in the room, for there was no need of chairs.\n",
            "   He did not sit, he did not recline, he “prolonged” himself on the largest bed in history. The dimensions might easily have been fifteen feet by twenty. It reminded me of the apartment of a writer I once knew who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs.\n",
            "   So it was with this nest, with Dorian, immense, a gelatinous skin, a vitreous shape, undulant within that nest.\n",
            "   And if Dorian was male or female, I could not guess. This was a great pudding, an emperor jellyfish, a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from the exterior of which, on occasion, noxious gases escaped with rubbery sounds; great lips sibilating. That and the sough of that labored pump, that constant inhalation, were the only sounds within the chamber as I stood, anxious, alarmed, but at last impressed by this beached creature, cast up from a dark landfall. The thing was a gelatinous cripple, an octopus without limbs, an amphibian stranded, unable to undulate and seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay, featureless, with a mere x-ray ghost of legs, arms, wrists, and hands with skeletal fingers. At last I could discern, at the far end of this flesh peninsula, what seemed a half-flat face with a frail phantom of skull beneath, an open fissure for an eye, a ravenous nostril, and a red wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth.\n",
            "   And at last this thing, this Dorian, spoke.\n",
            "   Or whispered, or lisped.\n",
            "   And with each lisp, each sibilance, an odor of decay was expelled as if from a vast night-swamp balloon, sunk on its side, lost in fetid water as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks. It expelled but one lingering syllable:\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   Yes what?\n",
            "   And then it added:\n",
            "   Soooo...\n",
            "   “How long... how long,” I murmured, “has it... has he been here?”\n",
            "   “No one knows. When Victoria was Queen? When Booth emptied his makeup kit to load his pistol? When Napoleon yellow-stained the Moscow snows? Forevers not bad .\n",
            "   What else?”\n",
            "   I swallowed hard. “Is... is he?”\n",
            "   “Dorian? Dorian of the attic? He of the Portrait? And somewhere along the line found portraits not enough? Oil, canvas, no depth. The world needed something that could soak in, sponge the midnight rains, breakfast and lunch on loss, depravitys guilt. Something to truly take in, drink, digest; a pustule, imperial intestine. A rheum oesophagus for sin. A laboratory plate to take bacterial snows. Dorian.”\n",
            "   The long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and valves, and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the aqueous gels.\n",
            "   A slit widened to emit gas and again the single word:\n",
            "   Yessss .\n",
            "   “Hes welcoming you!” My host smiled.\n",
            "   “I know, I know,” I said impatiently. “But why? I dont even want to be here. Im ill. Why cant we go?”\n",
            "   “Because”-my host laughed-“you were selected.\n",
            "   “Selected?”\n",
            "   “Weve had our eye on you.”\n",
            "   “You mean youve watched, followed, spied on me? Christ, who gave you permission?”\n",
            "   “Temper, temper. Not everyone is picked.”\n",
            "   “Who said I wanted to be picked!?”\n",
            "   “If you could see yourself as we see you, youd know why.”\n",
            "   I turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it stare. Then all its apertures sealed: the saber-cut mouth, the slitted nostrils, the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless. The sibilance pumped with gaseous suctions.\n",
            "   Yessss, it whispered.\n",
            "   Lisssst, it murmured.\n",
            "   “And list it is!” My host pulled forth a small computer pad which he tapped to screen my name, address, and phone.\n",
            "   He glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me.\n",
            "   “Single,” he said.\n",
            "   “Married and divorced.”\n",
            "   “Now single! No women in your life?”\n",
            "   “Im walking wounded.”\n",
            "   He tapped his pad. “Visiting strange bars.”\n",
            "   “I hadnt noticed.”\n",
            "   “Creative blindness. Getting to bed late. Sleeping all day. Drinking heavily three nights a week.”\n",
            "   “Twice!”\n",
            "   “Going to the gym, look, every day. Workouts excessive. Prolonged steam baths, overlong massages. Sudden interest in sports. Endless basketball, soccer, tennis matches every night, and half the noons. Thats hyperventilation!”\n",
            "   “My business!”\n",
            "   “And ours! Youre balanced giddily on the rim. Shove all these facts in that one-armed bandit in your head, yank, and watch the lemons and ripe cherries spin. Yank!”\n",
            "   Jesus God. Yes! Bars. Drinks. Late nights. Gyms. Saunas. Masseurs. Basketball. Tennis. Soccer. Yank. Pull. Spin!\n",

            "   Gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless mound. Yessss.\n",
            "   They say that men in the grip of passion, blind to their own darkness, make love and run mad. Stunned by guilt, they find themselves beasts, having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church, town, parents, life. In explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure. Seeing her as unholy provocateur, they kill. Women, in similar rages and guilts, overdose. Eve lies self-slain in the Garden. Adam hangs himself with the Snake as noose.\n",
            "   But here was no passionate crime, no woman, no provocateur, only the great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host. And only words which riddled me with fusillades of arrows. Like an Oriental hedgehog, bristled with shafts, my body exploded with No, No, No. Echoed and then real:\n",
            "   “No!”\n",
            "   Yessss, whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue, the skeleton buried in ancient soups.\n",
            "   Yessss.\n",
            "   I gasped to see my games, steams, midnight bars, late-dawn beds: a maniac sum.\n",
            "   I rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked, creased, and oiled by passion, so cobwebbed and smashed by drink, that I tried to avert my gaze. The terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand. Stupidly, I reached to shake his and-rapped glass! A mirror. I stared deep into my own life. I had seen myself in shop windows, dim undersea men running in creeks. Mornings, shaving, I saw my mirrored health. But this! This troglodyte trapped in amber. Myself, snapshotted like ten dozen sexual acrobats! And who jammed this mirror at me? My beautiful host, and that corrupt flatulence beyond.\n",
            "   “You are selected,” they whispered.\n",
            "   “I refuse!” I shrieked.\n",
            "   And whether I shrieked aloud or merely thought, a great furnace gaped. The oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous streams. My beautiful host fell back, stunned that their search beneath my skin, behind my mask, had brought revulsion. Always when Dorian cried, “Friend,” raw gymnast teams had mobbed to catapult that armless, legless, featureless Sargasso Sea. Before they had smothered to drown in his miasma, to arise, embrace, and wrestle in the dark gymnasium, then run forth young to assault a world.\n",
            "   And I? What had I dared to do, that quaked that membranous sac into regurgitated whistling and broken winds?\n",
            "   “Idiot!” cried my host, all teeth and fists. “Out! Out!”\n",
            "   “Out,” I cried, spun to obey, and tripped.\n",
            "   I do not clearly know what happened as I fell. And if it was a swift reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that putrescent mound, I cannot say. I knew no lightning shock of murder, yet knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge. For what? I thought. What are you to Dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face, or causes the slightest twitch of leg, arm, hand, or fingernail, as the last fetid air from Dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils.\n",
            "   It was over in a second.\n",
            "   Something shoved me. Did my secret self, insulted, give that push? I was flung as if on wires, knocked to sprawl at Dorian.\n",
            "   He gave two terrible cries, one of warning, one of despair.\n",
            "   I was recovered so in landing, I did not sink my hands deep in that poisonous yeast, into that multiflorid Man of War jelly. I swear that I touched, raked, scarified him with only one thing: the smallest fingernail of my right hand.\n",
            "   My fingernail!\n",
            "   And so this Dorian was shot and foundered. And so the mammoth with screams collapsed. And so the nauseous balloon sank, fold on midnight fold, upon its own boneless sell, fissuring volcanic sulfurs, immense rectal airs, outgassed whistles, and whimpers of self-pitying despair.\n",
            "   “Christ! What have you done!? Murderer! Damn you!” cried my host, riven to stare at Dorians exhaustions unto death.\n",
            "   He whirled to strike, but ran to reach the door and cry, “Lock this! Lock! Whatever happens, for Gods sake, dont open! Now!” The door slammed. I ran to lock it and turn.\n",
            "   Quietly, Dorian was falling away.\n",
            "   He sank down and down, out of sight. Like a great membranous tent with its poles removed, he vanished into the floor, down flues and vents on all sides of his great platform nest. Vents obviously created for such a massive disease-sac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas. Even as I watched, the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents, and I stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable strata of discards and half-born fetuses had lain sucking at sins, spoiled bones, and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty. That perverse royalty, that lunatic monarch, gone, all gone. A last choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death.\n",
            "   My God, I thought, even now, that, all that, that terrible miasma, that stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on clean shores where bathers come at dawn... \n",
            "   Even now... \n",
            "   I stood, eyes shut, waiting.\n",
            "   For what? There had to be a  thing, yes? It came.\n",
            "   There was a trembling, shivering, and then a quaking of the wall, but especially the golden door behind me.\n",
            "   I spun to see as well as hear.\n",
            "   I saw the door shaken, and then bombarded from the other side. Fists pummeled, struck, hammered. Voices cried out and screamed and then shrieked.\n",
            "   I felt a great mass ram the door to shiver, to slam it on its hinges.\n",
            "   I stared, fearful that the door might explode and let in the flood tide of nightmare-ravening, terrified beasts, the kennel of dying things. For now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape, to beg for mercy, were so terrible that I clamped my fists to my ears.\n",
            "   Dorian was gone, but they remained. Shrieks. Screams. Screams. Shrieks. An avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell, yammering.\n",
            "   What must they look like now? I thought. All those bouquets. All those beauties.\n",
            "   The police will come, I thought, soon. But .\n",
            "   No matter what... \n",
            "   I would not unlock that door.\n",

            "   But to put it simply, the most respected member of the Bentley family up and died.\n",
            "   Dog was his name, and dog he was.\n",
            "   The Bentleys, arising late Saturday morning, found Dog stretched on the kitchen floor, his head toward Mecca, his paws neatly folded, his tail not a-thump but silent for the first time in twenty years.\n",
            "   Twenty years! My God, everyone thought, could it really have been that long? And now, without permission, Dog was cold and gone.\n",
            "   Susan, the younger daughter, woke everyone yelling:\n",
            "   “Somethings wrong with Dog. Quick!”\n",
            "   Without bothering to don his bathrobe, Roger Bentley, in his underwear, hurried out to look at that quiet beast on the\n",
            "   kitchen tiles. His wife, Ruth, followed, and then their son Skip, twelve. The rest of the family, married and flown, Rodney and Sal, would arrive later. Each in turn would say the same thing:\n",
            "   “No! Dog was forever.”\n",
            "   Dog said nothing, but lay there like World War II, freshly finished, and a devastation.\n",
            "   Tears poured down Susans cheeks, then down Ruth Bentleys, followed in good order by tears from Father and, at last, when it had sunk in, Skip.\n",
            "   Instinctively, they made a ring around Dog, kneeling to the floor to touch him, as if this might suddenly make him sit up, smile as he always did at his food, bark, and beat them to the door. But their touching did nothing but increase their tears.\n",
            "   But at last they rose, hugged each other, and went blindly in search of breakfast, in the midst of which Ruth Bentley said, stunned, “We cant just leave him there.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley picked Dog up, gently, and moved him out on the patio, in the shade, by the pool.\n",
            "   “What do we do ?”\n",
            "   “I dont know,” said Roger Bentley. “This is the first death in the family in years and—” He stopped, snorted, and shook his head. “I mean—”\n",
            "   “You meant exactly what you said,” said Ruth Bentley. “If Dog wasnt family, he was nothing. God, I loved him.”\n",
            "   A fresh burst of tears ensued, during which Roger Bentley brought a blanket to put over Dog, but Susan stopped him.\n",
            "   “No, no. 1 want to see him. I wont be able to see him ever again. Hes so beautiful. Hes so—old.”\n",
            "   They all carried their breakfasts out on the patio to sit around Dog, somehow feeling they couldnt ignore him by eating inside.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley telephoned his other children, whose response, after the first tears, was the same: theyd be right over. Wait.\n",
            "   When the other children arrived, first Rodney, twenty-one, and then the older daughter, Sal, twenty-four, a fresh storm of grief shook everyone and then they sat silently for a moment, watching Dog for a miracle.\n",
            "   “What are your plans?” asked Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “I know this is silly,” said Roger Bentley after an embarrassed pause. “After all, hes only a dog—”\n",
            "   “Only!?” cried everyone instantly.\n",
            "   Roger had to back off. “Look, he deserves the Taj Mahal. What hell get is the Orion Pet Cemetery over in Burbank.”\n",
            "   “Pet Cemetery!?” cried everyone, but each in a different way.\n",
            "   “My God,” said Rodney, “thats silly!”\n",
            "   “Whats so silly about it?” Skips face reddened and his lip trembled. “Dog, why, Dog was a pearl of... rare price.\n",
            "   “Yeah!” added Susan.\n",
            "   “Well, pardon me.” Roger Bentley turned away to look at the pool, the bushes, the sky. “I suppose I could call those trash people who pick up dead bodies—”\n",
            "   “Trash people?” exclaimed Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Dead bodies?” said Susan. “Dog isnt a dead body!”\n",
            "   “What is he, then?” asked Skip bleakly.\n",
            "   They all stared at Dog lying quietly there by the pool. “Hes,” blurted Susan at last, “hes... hes my love!” Before the crying could start again, Roger Bentley picked up the patio telephone, dialed the Pet Cemetery, talked, and put the phone down.\n",
            "   “Two hundred dollars,” he informed everyone. “Not bad.”\n",
            "   “For Dog?” said Skip. “Not enough!”\n",
            "   “Are you really serious about this?” asked Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   “Yeah,” said Roger. “Ive made fun of those places all my life. But, now, seeing as how well never be able to visit Dog again—” He let a moment pass. “Theyll come take Dog at noon. Services tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Services!” Snorting, Rodney stalked to the rim of the pool and waved his arms. “You wont get me to that!”\n",
            "   Everyone stared. Rodney turned at last and let his shoulders slump. “Hell, Ill be there.”\n",
            "   “Dog would never forgive you if you didnt.” Susan snuffed and wiped her nose.\n",
            "   But Roger Bentley had heard none of this. Staring at Dog, then his family, and up to the sky, he shut his eyes and exhaled a great whisper:\n",
            "   “Oh, my God!” he said, eyes shut. “Do you realize that this is the first terrible thing thats happened to our family? Have we ever been sick, gone to the hospital? Been in an accident?”\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   “No,” said everyone.\n",
            "   “Gosh,” said Skip.\n",
            "   “Gosh, indeed! You sure as hell notice accidents, sickness, hospitals.”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” said Susan, and had to stop and wait because her voice broke. “Maybe Dog died just to make us notice how lucky we are.”\n",
            "   “Lucky?!” Roger Bentley opened his eyes and turned. “Yes! You know what we are—”\n",
            "   “The science fiction generation,” offered Rodney, lighting a cigarette casually.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “You rave on about that, your school lectures, or during dinner. Can openers? Science fiction. Automobiles. Radio, TV, films. Everything! So science fiction!”\n",
            "   “Well, dammit, they are!” cried Roger Bentley and went to stare at Dog, as if the answers were there amongst the last departing fleas. “Hell, not so long ago there were no cars, can openers, TV. Someone had to dream them. Start of lecture. Someone had to build them. Mid-lecture. So science fiction dreams became finished science fact. Lecture finis!”\n",
            "   “I bet!” Rodney applauded politely.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley could only sink under the weight of his sons irony to stroke the dear dead beast.\n",
            "   “Sorry. Dog bit me. Cant help myself. Thousands of years, all we did is die. Now, that times over. In sum: science fiction.”\n",
            "   “Bull.” Rodney laughed. “Stop reading that junk, Dad.”\n",
            "   “Junk?” Roger touched Dogs muzzle. “Sure. But how about Lister, Pasteur, Salk? Hated death. Jumped to stop it. Thats all science fiction was ever about. Hating the way things are, wanting to make things different. Junk?!”\n",
            "   “Ancient history, Pop.”\n",
            "   “Ancient?” Roger Bentley fixed his son with a terrible eye. “Christ. When I was born in 1920, if you wanted to visit your family on Sundays you—”\n",
            "   “Went to the graveyard?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Yes. My brother and sister died when I was seven. Half of my family gone! Tell me, dear children, how many of your friends died while you were growing up. In grammar school? High school?”\n",
            "   He included the family in his gaze, and waited.\n",
            "   “None,” said Rodney at last.\n",
            "   “None! You hear that? None! Christ. Six of my best friends died by the time I was ten! Wait! I just remembered!”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley hurried to rummage in a hall closet and brought out an old 78-rpm record into the sunlight, blowing off the dust. He squinted at the label:\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?”\n",
            "   Everyone came to look at the ancient disc.\n",
            "   “Hey, how old is that?”\n",
            "   “Heard it a hundred times when I was a kid in the twenties,” said Roger.\n",
            "   “No News, Or What Killed The Dog?” Sal glanced at her fathers face.\n",
            "   “This gets played at Dogs funeral,” he said.\n",
            "   “Youre not serious?” said Ruth Bentley.\n",
            "   Just then the doorbell rang.\n",
            "   “That cant be the Pet Cemetery people come to take Dog-?”\n",
            "   “No!” cried Susan. “Not so soon!”\n",
            "   Instinctively, the family formed a wall between Dog and the doorbell sound, holding off eternity.\n",
            "   Then they cried, one more time.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The strange and wonderful thing about the funeral was how many people came.\n",
            "   “I didnt know Dog had so many friends,” Susan blubbered.\n",
            "   “He freeloaded all around town,” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “Speak kindly of the dead.”\n",
            "   “Well, he did, dammit., Otherwise why is Bill Johnson here, or Gert Skall, or Jim across the street?”\n",
            "   “Dog,” said Roger Bentley, “I sure wish you could see this.”\n",
            "   “He does.” Susans eyes welled over. “Wherever he is.”\n",
            "   “Good old Sue,” whispered Rodney, “who cries at telephone books—”\n",
            "   “Shut up!” cried Susan.\n",
            "   “Hush, both of you.”\n",
            "   And Roger Bentley moved, eyes down, toward the front of the small funeral parlor where Dog was laid out, head on paws, in a box that was neither too rich nor too simple but just right.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley placed a steel needle down on the black record which turned on top of a flake-painted portable phonograph. The needle scratched and hissed. All the neighbors leaned forward.\n",
            "   “No funeral oration,” said Roger quickly. “Just this .. And a voice spoke on a day long ago and told a story about a man who returned from vacation to ask friends what had happened while he was gone.\n",
            "   It seemed that nothing whatsoever had happened. Oh, just one thing. Everyone wondered what had killed the dog.\n",
            "   The dog? asked the vacationer. My dog died? Yes, and maybe it was the burned horseflesh did it. Burned horseflesh!? cried the vacationer. Well, said his informant, when the barn burned, the horseflesh caught fire, so the dog ate the burned horseflesh, died.\n",
            "   The barn!? cried the vacationer. How did it catch fire? Well, sparks from the house blew over, torched the barn, burned the horseflesh, dog ate them, died.\n",
            "   Sparks from the house!? shouted the vacationer. How-?\n",
            "   It was the curtains in the house, caught fire.\n",
            "   Curtains? Burned!?\n",
            "   From the candles around the coffin.\n",
            "   Coffin!?\n",
            "   Your aunts funeral coffin, candles there caught the curtains, house burned, sparks from the house flew over, burned down the barn, dog ate the burned horseflesh-In sum: no news, or what killed the dog!\n",
            "   The record hissed and stopped.\n",
            "   In the silence, there was a little quiet laughter, even though the record had been about dogs and people dying.\n",
            "   “Now, do we get the lecture?” said Rodney.\n",
            "   “No, a sermon.”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley put his hands on the pulpit to stare for long moments at notes he hadnt made.\n",
            "   “I dont know if were here for Dog or ourselves. Both, I suppose. Were the nothing-ever-happened-to-us people. Today is a first. Not that I want a rush of doom or disease. God forbid. Death, come slowly, please.”\n",
            "   He turned the phonograph record round and round in his hands, trying to read the words under the grooves.\n",
            "   “No news. Except the aunts funeral candles catch the curtains, sparks fly, and the dog goes west. In our lives, just the opposite. No news for years. Good livers, healthy hearts, good times. So-whats it all about?”\n",
            "   Roger Bentley glanced at Rodney, who was checking his wristwatch.\n",
            "   “Someday we must die, also.” Roger Bentley hurried on. “Hard to believe. Were spoiled. But Susan was right. Dog died to tell us this, gently, and we must believe. And at the same time celebrate. What? The fact that were the start of an amazing, dumbfounding history of survival that will only get better as the centuries pass. You may argue that the  war will take us all. Maybe.\n",
            "   “I can only say I think you will grow to be old, very old people. Ninety years from now, most people will have cured hearts, stopped cancers, and jumped life cycles. A lot of sadness will have gone out of the world, thank God. Will this be easy to do? No. Will we do it? Yes. Not in all countries, right off. But, finally, in most.\n",
            "   “As I said yesterday, fifty years ago, if you wanted to\n",
            "   visit your aunts, uncles, grandparents, brothers, sisters, the graveyard was it. Death was all the talk. You had to talk it. Times up, Rodney?”\n",
            "   Rodney signaled his father he had one last minute.\n",
            "   Roger Bentley wound it down:\n",
            "   “Sure, kids still die. But not millions. Old folks? Wind up in Sun City instead of marble Orchard.”\n",
            "   The father surveyed his family, bright-eyed, in the pews.\n",
            "   “God, look at you! Then look back. A thousand centuries of absolute terror, absolute grief. How parents stayed sane to raise their kids when half of them died, damned if I know. Yet with broken hearts, they did. While millions died of flu or the Plague.\n",
            "   “So here we are in a new time that we cant see because we stand in the eye of the hurricane, where everythings calm.\n",
            "   “Ill shut up now, with a last word for Dog. Because we loved him, weve done this almost silly thing, this service, but now suddenly were not ashamed or sorry we bought him a plot or had me speak. We may never come visit him, who can say? But he has a place. Dog, old boy, bless you. Now, everyone, blow your nose.”\n",
            "   Everyone blew his nose.\n",
            "   “Dad,” said Rodney suddenly, “could-we hear the record again?”\n",
            "   Everyone looked at Rodney, surprised.\n",

            "   He put the needle on the record. It hissed.\n",
            "   About a minute in, when the sparks from the house flew over to burn the barn and torch the horseflesh and kill the dog, there was a sound at the back doorway to the small parlor.\n",
            "   Everyone turned.\n",
            "   A strange man stood in the door holding a small wicker basket from which came familiar, small yapping sounds.\n",

            "   The whole family, drawn out into the sunlight, gathered around the stranger with the wicker basket, waiting for Father to arrive to throw back the coverlet on the small carrier so they could all dip their hands in.\n",

            "   It was a pounding on a door, a furious, frantic, insistent pounding, born of hysteria and fear and a great desire to be heard, to be freed, to be let loose, to escape. It was a wrenching at hidden paneling, it was a hollow knocking, a rapping, a testing, a clawing! It was a scratching at hollow boards, a ripping at bedded nails; it was a muffled closet shouting and demanding, far away, and a call to be noticed, followed by a silence.\n",

            "   Now whoever it was who had pounded and rapped and made his fingers raw, drawn blood with his fever and quest to be free, had drawn into silence, listening himself to see if his terror and drumming had summoned any help.\n",
            "   The winter night lay through the house with a falling-snow silence, silence snowing into every room, drifting over tables and floors, and banking up the stairwell.\n",
            "   Then the pounding started again. And then:\n",
            "   A sound of soft crying.\n",
            "   “Downstairs.”\n",
            "   “Someone in the house.”\n",
            "   “Lotte, do you think? The front doors unlocked.”\n",
            "   “Shed have knocked. Cant be Lotte.”\n",
            "   “Shes the only one it could be. She phoned.”\n",
            "   They both glanced at the phone. If you lifted the receiver, you heard a winter stillness. The phones were dead. They had died days ago with the riots in the nearest towns and cities. Now, in the receiver, you heard only your own heart-beat. “Can you put me up?” Lone had cried from six hundred miles away. “Just overnight?”\n",
            "   But before they could answer her, the phone had filled itself with long miles of silence.\n",
            "   “Lotte is coming. She sounded hysterical. That might be her,” said Martha Webb.\n",
            "   “No,” said Robert. “I heard that crying other nights, too. Dear God.”\n",
            "   They lay in the cold room in this farmhouse back in the Massachusetts wilderness, back from the main roads, away from the towns, near a bleak river and a black forest. It was the frozen middle of December. The white smell of snow cut the air.\n",
            "   They arose. With an oil lamp lit, they sat on the edge of the bed as if dangling their legs over a precipice.\n",
            "   “Theres no one downstairs, there cant be.”\n",
            "   “Whoever it is sounds frightened.”\n",
            "   “Were all frightened, damn it. Thats why we came out here, to be away from cities, riots, all that damned foolishness. No more wiretaps, arrests, taxes, neurotics. Now when we find it at last, people call and upset us. And tonight this, Christ!” He glanced at his wife. “You afraid?”\n",
            "   “I dont know. I dont believe in ghosts. This is 1999; Im sane. Or like to think I am. Wheres your gun?”\n",
            "   “We wont need it. Dont ask me why, but we wont.” They picked up their oil lamps. In another month the small power plant would be finished in the white barns behind the house and thered be power to spare, but now they haunted the farm, coming and going with dim lamps or candles.\n",
            "   They stood at the stairwell, both thirty-three, both immensely practical.\n",
            "   The crying, the sadness, and the plea came from below in the winter rooms.\n",
            "   “She sounds so damned sad,” said Robert. “God, Im sorry for her, but dont even know who it is. Come on.”\n",
            "   They went downstairs.\n",
            "   As if hearing their footsteps, the crying grew louder. There was a dull thudding against a hidden panel somewhere.\n",
            "   “The Witch Door!” said Martha Webb at last.\n",
            "   “Cant be.”\n",
            "   “Is.”\n",
            "   They stood in the long hall looking at that place under the stairs, where the panels trembled faintly. But now the cries faded, as if the crier was exhausted, or something had diverted her, or perhaps their voices had startled her and she was listening for them to speak again. Now the winter-night house was silent and the man and wife waited with the oil lamps quietly fuming in their hands.\n",
            "   Robert Webb stepped to the Witch Door and touched it, probing for the hidden button, the secret spring. “There cant be anyone in there,” he said. “My God, weve been here six months, and thats just a cubby. Isnt that what the Realtor said when he sold the place? No one could hide in there and us not know it. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen!”\n",
            "   They listened.\n",
            "   Nothing.\n",
            "   “Shes gone, its gone, whatever it was, hell, that door hasnt been opened in our lifetime. Everyones forgotten where the spring is that unlocks it. I dont think there is a door, only a loose panel, and rats” nests, thats all. The walls, scratching. Why not?” He turned to look at his wife, who was staring at the hidden place.\n",
            "   “Silly,” she said. “Good Lord, rats dont cry. That was a voice, asking to be saved. Lotte, I thought. But now I know it wasnt she, but someone else in as much trouble.”\n",
            "   Martha Webb reached out and trembled her fingertips along the beveled edge of ancient maple. “Cant we open it?”\n",
            "   “With a crowbar and hammer, tomorrow.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Robert!”\n",
            "   “Dont “Oh, Robert” me. Im tired.”\n",
            "   “You cant leave her in there to—”\n",
            "   “Shes quiet now. Christ, Im exhausted. Ill come down at the crack of dawn and knock the damned thing apart, okay?”\n",
            "   “All right,” she said, and tears came to her eyes.\n",
            "   “Women,” said Robert Webb. “Oh, my God, you and Lotte, Lotte and you. If she is coming here, if she makes it, Ill have a houseful of lunatics!”\n",
            "   “Lottes fine!”\n",
            "   “Sure, but she should keep her mouth shut. It doesnt pay now to say youre Socialist, Democrat, Libertarian, Pro-Life Abortionist, Sinn Fein Fascist, Commie, any damn thing. The towns are bombed out. People are looking for scapegoats and Lotte has to shoot from the hip, get herself smeared and now, hell, on the run.”\n",
            "   “Theyll jail her if they catch her. Or kill her, yes, kill her. Were lucky to be here with our own food. Thank God we planned ahead, we saw it coming, the starvation, the massacres. We helped ourselves. Now we help Lone if she makes it through.”\n",
            "   Without answering, he turned to the stairs. “Im dead on my feet. Im tired of saving anyone. Even Lotte. But hell, if she comes through the front door, shes saved.”\n",
            "   They went up the stairs taking the lamps, advancing in an ever-moving aura of trembling white glow. The house was as silent as snow falling. “God,” he whispered. “Damn, I dont like women crying like that.”\n",
            "   It sounded like the whole world crying, he thought. The whole world dying and needing help and lonely, but what can you do? Live in a farm like this? Far off the main highway where people dont pass, away from all the stupidity and death? What can you do?\n",
            "   They left one of the lamps lit and drew the covers over their bodies and lay, listening to the wind hit the house and creak the beams and parquetry.\n",
            "   A moment later there was a cry from downstairs, a splintering crash, the sound of a door flung wide, a bursting out of air, footsteps rapping all the rooms, a sobbing, almost an exultation, then the front door banged open, the winter wind blowing wildly in, footsteps across the front porch and gone.\n",
            "   “There!” cried Martha. “Yes!”\n",
            "   With the lamp they were down the stairs swiftly. Wind smothered their faces as they turned now toward the Witch Door, opened wide, still on its hinges, then toward the front door where they cast their light out upon a snowing winter darkness and saw nothing but white and hills, no moon, and in the lamplight the soft drift and moth-flicker of snowflakes falling from the sky to the mattressed yard.\n",
            "   “Gone,” she whispered.\n",
            "   “Who?”\n",
            "   “Well never know, unless she comes back.”\n",
            "   “She wont. Look.”\n",
            "   They moved the lamplight toward the white earth and the tiny footprints going off, across the softness, toward the dark forest.\n",
            "   “It was a woman, then. But... why?”\n",
            "   “God knows. Why anything, now in this crazy world?” They stood looking at the footprints a long while until, shivering, they moved back through the hall to the open Witch Door. They poked the lamp into this hollow under the stairs.\n",
            "   “Lord, its just a cell, hardly a closet, and look...”\n",
            "   Inside stood a small rocking chair, a braided rug, a used candle in a copper holder, and an old, worn Bible. The place smelled of must and moss and dead flowers.\n",
            "   “Is this where they used to hide people?”\n",
            "   “Yes. A long time back they hid people called witches. Trials, witch trials. They hung or burned some.”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes,” they both murmured, staring into the incredibly small cell.\n",
            "   “And the witches hid here while the hunters searched the house and gave up and left?”\n",
            "   “Yes, oh, my God, yes,” he whispered.\n",
            "   “Rob\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   She bent forward. Her face was pale and she could not look away from the small, worn rocking chair and the faded Bible.\n",
            "   “Rob. How old? This house, how old?”\n",
            "   “Maybe three hundred years.\n",
            "   “That old?”\n",
            "   “Why?”\n",
            "   “Crazy. Stupid...\n",
            "   “Crazy?”\n",
            "   “Houses, old like this. All the years. And more years and more after that. God, feel! If you put your hand in, yes? Would you feel it change, silly, and what if I sat in that rocking chair and shut the door, what? That woman... how long was she in there? Howd she get there? From way, way back. Wouldnt it be strange?”\n",
            "   “Bull!”\n",
            "   “But if you wanted to run away badly enough, wished for it, prayed for it, and people ran after you, and someone hid you in a place like this, a witch behind a door, and heard the searchers run through the house, closer and closer, wouldnt you want to get away? Anywhere? To another place? Why not another time? And then, in a house like this, a house so old nobody knows, if you wanted and asked for it enough, couldnt you run to another year! Maybe”-she paused-“here...?”\n",
            "   “No, no,” he muttered. “Really stupid!”\n",
            "   But still, some quiet motion within the closeted space caused both, at almost the same instant, to hold their hands out on the air, curious, like people testing invisible waters. The air seemed to move one way and then another, now warm, now cold, with a pulsation of light and a sudden turning toward dark. All this they thought but could not say. There was weather here, now a quick touch of summer and then a winter cold, which could not be, of course, but there it was. Passing along their fingertips, but unseen by their eyes, a stream of shadows and sun ran as invisible as time itself, clear as crystal, but clouded by a shifting dark. Both felt if they thrust their hands deep, they might be drawn in to drown in a mighty storm of seasons within an incredibly small space. All this, too, they thought or almost felt but could not say.\n",
            "   They seized their frozen but sunburned hands back, to stare down and hold them against the panic in their breasts.\n",
            "   “Damn,” whispered Robert Webb. “Oh, damn!” He backed off and went to open the front door again and look at the snowing night where the footprints had almost vanished.\n",
            "   “No” he said. “No, no.”\n",
            "   Just then the yellow flash of headlights on the road braked in front of the house.\n",
            "   “Lotte!” cried Martha Webb. “It must be! Lotte!” The car lights went out. They ran to meet the running woman half up the front yard.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   The woman, wild-eyed, hair windblown, threw herself at them.\n",
            "   “Martha, Bob! God, I thought Id never find you! Lost! Im being followed, lets get inside. Oh, I didnt mean to get you up in the middle of the night, its good to see you! Jesus! Hide the car! Here are the keys!”\n",
            "   Robert Webb ran to drive the car behind the house. When he came back around he saw that the heavy snowfall was already covering the tracks.\n",
            "   Then the three of them were inside the house, talking, holding onto each other. Robert Webb kept glancing at the front door.\n",
            "   “I cant thank you,” cried Lotte, huddled in a chair. “Youre at risk! I wont stay long, a few hours until its safe. Then...\n",
            "   “Stay as long as you want.”\n",
            "   “No. Theyll follow! In the cities, the fires, the murders, everyone starving, I stole gas. Do you have more? Enough to get me to Phil Merdiths in Greenborough? I—”\n",
            "   “Lotte,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “Yes?” Lotte stopped, breathless.\n",
            "   “Did you see anyone on your way up here? A woman? Running on the road?”\n",
            "   “What? I drove so fast! A woman? Yes! I almost hit her. Then she was gone! Why?”\n",
            "   “Well...\n",
            "   “Shes not dangerous?”\n",
            "   “No, no.”\n",
            "   “It is all right, my being here?”\n",
            "   “Yes, fine, fine. Sit back. Well fix some coffee—”\n",
            "   “Wait! Ill check!” And before they could stop her, Lotte ran to the front door, opened it a crack, and peered out. They stood with her and saw distant headlights flourished over a low hill and gone into a valley. “Theyre coming,” whispered Lotte. “They might search here. God, where can I hide?”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert glanced at each other.\n",
            "   No, no, thought Robert Webb. God, no! Preposterous, unimaginable, fantastic, so damned coincidental the mind raves at it, crows, hoots, guffaws! No, none of this! Get oft” circumstance! Get away with your goings and comings on not neat, or too neat, schedules. Come back, Lotte, in ten years, five years, maybe a year, a month, a week, and ask to hide. Even tomorrow show up! But dont come with coincidence in each hand like idiot children and ask, only half an hour after one terror, one miracle, to test our disbelief! Im not, after all, Charles Dickens, to blink and let this pass.\n",
            "   “Whats wrong?” said Lotte.\n",
            "   “I—” said Robert.\n",
            "   “No place to hide me?”\n",
            "   “Yes,” he said. “Weve a place.”\n",
            "   “Well?”\n",
            "   “Here.” He turned slowly away, stunned.\n",
            "   They walked down the hall to the half-open paneling.\n",
            "   “This?” Lotte said. “Secret? Did you-7”\n",
            "   “No” its been here since the house was built long ago.” Lotte touched and moved the door on its hinges. “Does it work? Will they know where to look and find it?”\n",
            "   “No. Its beautifully made. Shut, you cant tell its there.” Outside in the winter night, cars rushed, their beams flashing up the road, across the house windows.\n",
            "   Lotte peered into the Witch Door as one peers down a deep, lonely well.\n",
            "   A filtering of dust moved about her. The small rocking chair trembled.\n",
            "   Moving in silently, Lotte touched the half-burned candle.\n",
            "   “Why, its still warm!”\n",
            "   Martha and Robert said nothing. They held to the Witch Door, smelling the odor of warm tallow.\n",
            "   Lotte stood rigidly in the little space, bowing her head beneath the beamed ceiling.\n",
            "   A horn blew in the snowing night. Lotte took a deep breath and said, “Shut the door.”\n",
            "   They shut the Witch Door. There was no way to tell that a door was there.\n",
            "   They blew out the lamp and stood in the cold, dark house, waiting.\n",
            "   The cars rushed down the road, their noise loud, and their yellow headlights bright in the falling snow. The wind stirred the footprints in the yard, one pair going out, another coming in, and the tracks of Lottes car fast vanishing, and at last gone.\n",
            "   “Thank God,” whispered Martha.\n",
            "   The cars, honking, whipped around the last bend and down the hill and stopped, waiting, looking in at the dark house. Then, at last, they started up away into the snow and the hills.\n",
            "   Soon their lights were gone and their sound gone with them.\n",
            "   “We were lucky,” said Robert Webb.\n",
            "   “But shes not.”\n",
            "   “She?”\n",
            "   “That woman, whoever she was, ran out of here. Theyll find here. Somebodyll find her.”\n",
            "   “Christ, thats right.”\n",
            "   “And she has no I. D., no proof of herself. And she doesnt know whats happened to her. And when she tells them who she is and where she came from!”\n",
            "   “Yes, yes.”\n",
            "   “God help her.”\n",
            "   They looked into the snowing night but saw nothing. Everything was still. “You cant escape,” she said. “No matter what you do, no one can escape.”\n",
            "   They moved away from the window and down the hall to the Witch Door and touched it.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they called.\n",
            "   The Witch Door did not tremble or move. “Lotte, you can come out now.” There was no answer; not a breath or a whisper. Robert tapped the door. “Hey in there.” “Lotte!”\n",
            "   He knocked at the paneling, his mouth agitated. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   “Open it!”\n",
            "   “Im trying, damn it!”\n",
            "   “Lotte, well get you out, wait! Everythings all right!”\n",
            "   He beat with both fists, cursing. Then he said, “Watch\n",
            "   out!” took a step back, raised his leg, kicked once, twice, three times; vicious kicks at the paneling that crunched holes and crumbled wood into kindling. He reached in and yanked the entire paneling free. “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They leaned together into the small place under the stairs. The candle flickered on the small table. The Bible was\n",
            "   gone. The small rocking chair moved quietly back and forth, in little arcs, and then stood still.\n",
            "   “Lotte!”\n",
            "   They stared at the empty room. The candle flickered.\n",
            "   “Lotte,” they said.\n",

            "   “Then shes safe at least, safe! Thank God!”\n",
            "   “Safe? Wheres she gone? You really think that? A woman in new clothes, red lipstick, high heels, short skirt, perfume, plucked brows, diamond rings, silk stockings, safe? Safe!” he said, staring deep into the open frame of the Witch Door.\n",
            "   “Yes, safe. Why not?”\n",
            "   He drew a deep breath.\n",
            "   “A woman of that description, lost in a town called Salem in the year 1680?”\n",

            "   The talk in the village in the year 1853 was, of course, about the madman above, in his sod-and-brick hut, with an untended garden and a wife who had fled, silent about his madness, never to return.\n",
            "   The people of the village had never drunk enough courage to go see what the special madness was or why the wife had vanished, tear-stained, leaving a vacuum into which atmospheres had rushed to thunder-clap.\n",
            "   And yet... \n",
            "   On a sweltering hot day with no cloud to offer shadow comfort and no threat of rain to cool man or beast, the Searcher arrived. Which is to say, Dr. Mortimer Goff, a man of many parts, most of them curious and self-serving, but also traveling the world for some baroque event, or miraculous revelation.\n",
            "   The good doctor came tramping up the hill, stumbling over cobbles that were more stone than paving, having abandoned his coach-and-horses, fearful of crippling them with such a climb.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff it turned out, had come from London, inhaling fogs, bombarded by storms, and now, stunned by too much light and heat, this good if curious physician stopped, exhausted, to lean against a fence, sight further up the hill, and ask:\n",
            "   “Is this the way to the lunatic?”\n",
            "   A farmer who was more scarecrow than human raised his eyebrows and snorted, “That would be Elijah Wetherby.”\n",
            "   “If lunatics have names, yes.”\n",
            "   “We call him crazed or mad, but lunatic will do. It sounds like book learning. Are you one of those?”\n",
            "   “I own books, yes, and chemical retorts and a skeleton that was once a man, and a permanent pass to the London Historical and Scientific Museum—”\n",
            "   “All well and good,” the farmer interrupted, “but of no use for failed crops and a dead wife. Follow your nose. And when you find the fool or whatever you name him, take him with you. Were tired of his shouts and commotions late nights in his iron foundry and anvil menagerie. Rumor says he will soon finish some monster that will run to kill us all.”\n",
            "   “Is that true?” asked Dr. Goff.\n",
            "   “No, it lies easy on my tongue. Good day, Doctor, and God deliver you from the lightning bolts that wait for you above.”\n",
            "   With this the farmer spaded the earth to bury the conversation.\n",
            "   So the curious doctor, threatened, climbed on, under a dark cloud which did not stop the sun.\n",

I am Dr. Goff, the so-called Searcher, for I move in behalf of our good Queen, turning rocks, digging truffles, curious for stuffs that might delight her Majesty or fill her museums, shops, and streets in the greatest city in the world. Have I reached the right place?”\n",
            "   “And just in time, for I am now in my eightieth year and of inconsequential vigor. If you had arrived  year, you might have found me in the churchyard. Do come in!”\n",
            "   At this moment, Dr. Goff heard a gathering of people behind him, all with a most unpleasant muttering, so at Mr. Wetherbys beckoning, he was glad to enter, sit, and watch an almost rare whiskey being poured without invitation. When he had quaffed the glass, Dr. Goff swiveled his gaze about the room.\n",
            "   “Well, where is it?”\n",
            "   “Where is what, sir?”\n",
            "   “The lunatic device, the insane machine that goes nowhere but in going might run down a child, a lamb, a priest, a nun, or an old blind dog, where?”\n",
            "   “So I am that famous, am I?” The old man let a few crumbs of laughter fall from his toothless mouth. “Well, sir. I keep it locked in the goats” shed behind: the outhouse of machines. Finish that to strengthen your sanity when you at last behold the delight and grievance of my long inventive life. So!”\n",
            "   The doctor drank, was replenished and soon out the door, across a small, smooth circle of turf, and to a shed whose door was triple-kept with numerous padlocks and keys. Old Wetherby entered, lit many candles, and beckoned the good doctor in.\n",
            "   He pointed as to a manger. The medical Searcher looked, expecting a mother, crib, and holy babe by the way Wetherby gestured and cried:\n",
            "   “There she be!”\n",
            "   “Is it female, then?”\n",
            "   “Come to think, she is!”\n",
            "   And there in the candlelight was Wetherbys mechanical pride.\n",
            "   Dr. Goff coughed, to hide his chagrin.\n",
            "   “That, sir, is but a metal frame!”\n",
            "   “But what a frame to hold velocities! Ha!”\n",
            "   And the old man, young with fevers, rushed to seize a largish wheel which he transported to fit to the front part of the frame. Then he fetched yet another circular object to fit into the frames rear.\n",
            "   “Well?” he cried.\n",
            "   “I see two wheels, half a cart, and no horse!”\n",
            "   “We will shoot all horses!” exclaimed Wetherby. “My invention, by the tens of thousands, will shy off all horses and banish manures. Do you know, each day in London a thousand tons of horse clods must be cleared, fertilizer wasted, not spread on neighbor fields but dumped as sludge down-Thames. God, how I talk!”\n",
            "   “But, sir, continue. Those look to be spinning wheels, borrowed from nearby farms?”\n",
            "   “They are, but spliced and strengthened with metal to sustain”—Wetherby touched himself—”one hundred twenty pounds. And heres the saddle for that weight.” Whereupon he fitted a saddle mid-frame. “And here the stirrups and ribbon to run the back wheel.” So saying, he affixed a longish leather ribbon to one stirrups rotary and tightened it on a spool at the rear.\n",
            "   “Do you begin to perceive, Doctor?”\n",
            "   “I am stranded in ignorance, sir.\n",
            "   “Well, then, be alert, for I now enthrone myself.”\n",
            "   And the old man, light as a chimpanzee, slung himself in place on a leather seat mid-frame between the silent spinning wheels.\n",
            "   “I still see no horse, sir.”\n",
            "   “I am the horse, Doctor. I am the horse a-gallop!”\n",
            "   And the old man thrust his feet in the stirrups to chum them up, around, and down; up, around, and down; as the rear wheels, provoked, did likewise, up, down, around, with a lovely hum, fastened in place on the platform planks.\n",
            "   “Aha.” The doctors face brightened. “This is a device to manufacture electrical power? Something from Benjamin Franklins storm-lightning notebooks?!”\n",
            "   “Gods, no. It could make lightnings, yes! But this, sir, not seeming one, is a horse, and I its night rider! So!”\n",
            "   And Wetherby pumped and wheezed, wheezed and pumped, and the rear wheels, locked in place, spun faster, faster, with a siren whine.\n",
            "   “All very well,” snorted the good doctor, “but the horse, if it is, and the rider, if you are, seem to be going nowhere! What will you call your machine?”\n",
            "   “I have had many nights and years to think.” Wetherby pumped and wheezed. “The Velocitor, perhaps.” Pumpwheeze. “Or the Precipitor, but no, that sounds as if I might be thrown from my “horse. “The Galvanizer, yes? Or why not—” Wheeze-pump. “The Landstride or Diminisher, for—” Wheeze-pump. “It does diminish time and distance. Doctor, you know Latin, eh? So, feet to wheel, wheel run by feet name it!”\n",
            "   “The Elijah, your given name, sir, the Elijah.”\n",
            "   “But he saw a wheel way in the middle of the air and it was a wheel in a wheel, is that not so?”\n",
            "   “When last I was in church, yes. And you are grounded, that is plain to see. Why not Velocipede, then? Having to do with speed and the applied toe and ankle?”\n",
            "   “Close-on, Dr. Goff, close-on. Why do you stare so fixedly?”\n",
            "   “It comes to mind that great times call forth great inventions. The inventor is child to his year and day. This is not a great time for such as you and yours. Did this century call you forth as its mightiest of all men of genius?”\n",
            "   Old Wetherby let his machine coast for a moment and smiled.\n",
            "   “No, I and my Tilda here, I call her Tilda, will instead be the gravity that calls forth the century. We will influence the year, the decade, and the millennium!”\n",
            "   “It is hard for me to believe,” said the medical gentleman, “that you will build a road from your sill to the city on which to glide your not-inconsiderable dream.”\n",
            "   “Nay, Doctor, the reverse is true. The city, and the world when they know me1 and this will run a concourse here to deliver me to fame.”\n",
            "   “Your head knocks heaven, Mr. Wetherby,” said the doctor dryly. “But your roots ache for sustenance, water, minerals, air. You stroke and pump wildly, but go nowhere. Once off that rack, will you not fall on your side, destroyed?”\n",
            "   “Nay, nay.” Wetherby, in gusts, pumped again. “For I have discovered some physics, as yet nameless. The faster you propel this bodily device, the less tendency to fall left or right but continue straight, if no obstacles prevent!”\n",
            "   “With only two wheels beneath? Prove it. Release your invention, set it free in flight, let us see you sustain your forward motion without breaking your bum!”\n",
            "   “Oh, God, shut up!” cried Wetherby as his kindling legs thrashed the pedals, racketing round as he leaned into a phantom wind, eyes clenched against an invisible storm, and churned the wheels to a frenzy. “Dont you hear? Listen. That whine, that cry, that whisper. The ghost in the machine, which promises things most new, unseen, unrealized, only a dream now but tomorrow—Great God, dont you see?! If I were on a real path this would be swifter than gazelles, a panic of deer! All pedestrians vanquished. All coach-and-horses in dust! Not twenty miles a day, but thirty, forty miles in a single glorious hour! Stand off, Time. Beware, meadow-beasts! Here glides, in full plummet, Wetherby with nothing to stop him!”\n",
            "   “Aye,” said the Searcher dryly, “you pump up a storm on that stand. But, set free, how would you balance on only two wheels!?”\n",
            "   “Like this!” cried Wetherby, and with a thrust of his hands and an uplift of frame, seized the Traveler, the Motion Machine, the Pathfinder, up free of its stand and in an instant plunged through the room and out the door, with Dr. Goff, in full pursuit, yelling:\n",
            "   “Stop! Youll kill yourself!”\n",
            "   “No, exhilarate my heart, oxygenate my blood!” cried Wetherby, and there he was in a chicken-yard he had trampled flat, paths some sixty feet around on which he now flailed his metal machine with scythings of ankle, toe, heel, and leg, sucking air, gusting out great laughs. “See? I do not fall! Two legs, two wheels, and: presto!”\n",
            "   “My God!” cried Dr. Goff, eyes thrust forth like hardboiled eggs. “Gods truth! How so?!”\n",
            "   “I fly forward faster than I fall downward, an unguessed law of physics. But lo! I almost fly. Fly! Good-bye horses, doomed and dead!”\n",
            "   And with “dead” he was overcome with such a delirium of pant and pump, perspiration raining off him in showers, that with a great cry, he wobbled and was flung, a meteor of flesh, over and down on a coop where the chickens, in dumb feather-duster alarms, exploded in shrieks as Wetherby slid in one direction while his vehicle, self-motivated, wheels a-spin, mounted Dr. Goff, who jumped aside, fearful of being spliced.\n",
            "   Wetherby, helped to his feet, protested his trajectory:\n",
            "   “Ignore that! Do you at last understand?”\n",
            "   “Fractures, wounds, broken skulls, yes!”\n",
            "   “No, a future brave with motion, “tween my legs. You have come a long way, Doctor. Will you adopt and further my machine?”\n",
            "   “Well,” said the doctor, already out of the yard, into the house, and to the front door, his face confused, his wits a patch of nettles. “Ah,” he said.\n",
            "   “Say you will, Doctor. Or my device dies, and I with it!”\n",
            "   “But...” said the doctor and opened the outer door, only to draw back, alarmed. “What have I done!” he cried.\n",
            "   Peering over his shoulder, Wetherby expressed further alarm. “Your presence is known, Doctor; the word has spread. A lunatic has come to visit a lunatic.”\n",
            "   And it was true. On the road and in the front garden yard were some twelve or twenty farmers and villagers, some with rocks, some with clubs, and with looks of malice or outright hostility caught in their eyes and mouths.\n",
            "   “There they are!” someone cried.\n",
            "   “Have you come to take him away?” someone else shouted.\n",
            "   “Yah” echoed the struggling crowd, moving forward.\n",
            "   Thinking quickly, Dr. Goff replied, “Yes. I will take him away!” And turned back to the old man.\n",
            "   “Take me where, Doctor?” whispered Wetherby, clutching his elbow.\n",
            "   “One moment!” cried the doctor to the crowd, which then subsided in murmurs. “Let me think.”\n",
            "   Standing back, cudgeling his bald spot, and then massaging his brow for rampant inspiration, Dr. Goff at last exhaled in triumph.\n",
            "   “I have it, by George. A genius of an idea, which will please both villagers, to be rid of you, and you, to be rid of them.”\n",
            "   “What, what, Doctor?”\n",
            "   “Why, sir, you are to come down to London under cover of night and I will let you through the side door of my museum with your blasphemous toy of Satan .\n",
            "   “To what purpose?”\n",
            "   “Purpose? Why, sir, I have found the path, the smooth surface, the road you spoke of at some future time!”\n",
            "   “The road, the path, the surface?”\n",
            "   “The museum floors, marble, smooth, lovely, wondrous, ohmigod, for all your needs!”\n",
            "   “Needs?”\n",
            "   “Dont be thick. Each night, as many nights as you wish, to your hearts content, you can ride that wheeled demon round and round, past the Rembrandts and Turners and Fra Angelicos, through the Grecian statues and Roman busts, careful of porcelains, minding the crystals, but pumping away like Lucifer all night till dawn!”\n",
            "   “Oh, dear God,” murmured Wetherby, “why didnt I think?”\n",
            "   “If you had you wouldve been too shy to ask!”\n",
            "   “The only place in the world with roads like future roads, paths like tomorrows paths, boulevards without cobbles, pure as Aphrodites cheeks! Smooth as Apollos rump!”\n",
            "   And here Wetherby unlocked his eyes to let fall tears, pent up for months and long hilltop years.\n",
            "   “Dont cry,” said Dr. Goff.\n",
            "   “I must, with joy, or burst. Do you mean it?”\n",
            "   “My good man, heres my hand!”\n",
            "   They shook and the shaking let free at least one drop of rain from the good doctors cheek, also.\n",
            "   “The excitement will kill me,” said Wetherby, wiping the backs of his fists across his eyes.\n",
            "   “No better way to die! Tomorrow night?”\n",
            "   “But what will people say as I lead my machine through the streets to your museum?”\n",
            "   “If anyone sees, say youre a gypsy whos stolen treasure from a distant year. Well, well, Elijah Wetherby, Im off.”\n",
            "   “Be careful downhill.”\n",
            "   “Careful.”\n",
            "   Half out the door, Dr. Goff tripped on a cobble and almost fell as a farmer said:\n",
            "   “Did you see the lunatic?”\n",
            "   “I did.”\n",
            "   “Will you take him to a madhouse?”\n",
            "   “Yes. Asylum.” Dr. Goff adjusted his cuffs. “Crazed. Worthless. You will see him no more!”\n",
            "   “Good!” said all as he passed.\n",
            "   “Grand,” said Goff and picked his way down the stone path, listening.\n",
            "   And uphill was there not a final, joyful, wheel-circling cry from that distant yard?\n",
            "   Dr. Goff snorted.\n",
            "   “Think on it,” he said, half aloud, “no more horses, no\n",
            "   more manure! Think!”\n",
            "   And, thinking, fell on the cobbles, lurching toward London and the future.\n",

            "   “Well,” said Sheila, chewing on her breakfast toast and examining her complexion, distorted in the side of the coffee urn, “here it is the last day of the last month of the ninth year.”\n",
            "   Her husband, Thomas, glanced over the rampart of The Wall Street Journa4 saw nothing to fasten his regard, and sank back in place. “What?”\n",
            "   “I said,” said Sheila, “the ninth years finished and you have a completely new wife. Or, to put it properly, the old wifes gone. So I dont think were married anymore.”\n",
            "   Thomas floored the Journal on his as-yet-untouched scrambled eggs, tilted his head this way and that, and said:\n",
            "   “Not married?”\n",
            "   “No, that was another time, another body, another me.” She buttered more toast and munched on it philosophically.\n",

            "   “Well, dear Thomas, dont you remember reading as children and later, that every nine years, I think it was nine, the body, churning like a gene-chromosome factory, did your entire person over, fingernails, spleen, ankles to elbows, belly, bum, and earlobes, molecule by molecule—”\n",
            "   “Oh, get to it,” he grumbled. “The point, wife, the point!”\n",
            "   “The point, dear Tom,” she replied, finishing her toast, “is that with this breakfast I have replenished my soul and psyche, completed the reworking of my entire flesh, blood, and bones. This person seated across from you is not the woman you married—”\n",

            "   “And if thats true, good Lord, then Im new, too. The old Tom, Thomas, Tommy, Tomasino is left behind back there with the shed snakeskin.”\n",
            "   Her eyes opened and she listened and he finished. “So were both brand-new. Youre the new, beautiful woman Ive been thinking about finding and loving in the last year. And Im that man you were heading out to search for. Isnt that right? Isnt that true?”\n",
            "   There was the merest hesitation and then she gave the smallest, almost imperceptible nod.\n",
            "   “Mercy,” he called gently.\n",
            "   “Thats not my name,” she said.\n",
            "   “It is now. New woman, new body, new name. So I picked one for you. Mercy?”\n",
            "   After a moment she said, “What does that make you?”\n",
            "   “Let me think.” He chewed his lip and smiled. “How about Frank? Frankly, my dear, I do give a damn.”\n",
            "   “Frank,” she murmured. “Frank and Mercy. Mercy and Frank.”\n",
            "   “It doesnt exactly ring, but itll do. Mercy?”\n",
            "   “Yes?”\n",
            "   “Will you marry me?”\n",
            "   \t“What?”\n",
            "   “I said, will you marry me. Today. An hour from now. Noon?”\n",
            "   She turned at last to look down at him with a face all freshly tanned and washed.\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” she said.\n",
            "   “And well run away and be maniacs again, for a little while\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “No,” she said, “here is fine. Here is wonderful.”\n",
            "   “Come down, then,” he said, holding his hand up to her. “We have another nine years before another change. Come down and finish your wedding breakfast. Mercy?”\n",
            "   She came down the steps and took his hand and smiled.\n",
            "   “Wheres the champagne?” she said.\n",

            "BUG\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Looking back now, I cant remember a time when Bug wasnt dancing. Bug is short for jitterbug and, of course, those were the days in the late thirties, our final days in high school and our first days out in the vast world looking for work that didnt exist when jitterbugging was all the rage. And I can remember Bug (his real name was Bert Bagley, which shortens to Bug nicely), during a jazz-band blast at our final aud-call for our high school senior class, suddenly leaping up to dance with an invisible partner in the middle of the front aisle of the auditorium. That brought the house down. You never heard such a roar or such applause. The bandleader, stricken with Bugs oblivious joy, gave an encore and Bug did the same and we all exploded. After that the band played “Thanks for the Memory” and we all sang it, with tears pouring down our cheeks. Nobody in all the years after could forget: Bug dancing in the aisle, eyes shut, hands out to grasp his invisible girlfriend, his legs not connected to his body, just his heart, all over the place. When it was over, nobody, not even the band, wanted to leave. We just stood there in the world Bug had made, hating to go out into that other world that was waiting for us.\n",
            "   It was about a year later when Bug saw me on the street and stopped his roadster and said come on along to my place for a hot dog and a Coke, and I jumped in and we drove over with the top down and the wind really hitting us and Bug talking and talking at the top of his lungs, about life and the times and what he wanted to show me in his front parlor-front parlor, hell, dining room, kitchen, and bedroom.\n",
            "   What was it he wanted me to see?\n",
            "   Trophies. Big ones, little ones, solid gold and silver and brass trophies with his name on them. Dance trophies. I mean they were everywhere, on the floor by his bed, on the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, but in the parlor, especially, they had settled like a locust plague. There were so many of them on the mantel, and in bookcases instead of books, and on the floor, you had to wade through, kicking some over as you went. They totaled, he said, tilting his head back and counting inside his eyelids, to about three hundred and twenty prizes, which means grabbing onto a trophy almost every night in the past year.\n",
            "   “All this,” I gasped, “just since we left high school?”\n",
            "   “Aint I the cats pajamas?” Bug cried.\n",
            "   “Youre the whole darned department store! Who was your partner, all those nights?”\n",
            "   “Not partner, partners,” Bug corrected. “Three hundred, give or take a dozen, different women on three hundred different nights.”\n",
            "   “Where do you find three hundred women, all talented, all good enough, to win prizes?”\n",
            "   “They werent talented or all good,” said Bug, glancing around at his collection. “They were just ordinary, good, every-night dancers. I won the prizes. I made them good. And when we got Out there dancing, we cleared the floor.\n",
            "   Everyone else stopped, to watch us there out in the middle of nowhere, and we never stopped.”\n",
            "   He paused, blushed, and shook his head. “Sorry about that. Didnt mean to brag.”\n",
            "   But he wasnt bragging. I could see. He was just telling the truth.\n",
            "   “You want to know how this all started?” said Bug, handing over a hot dog and a Coke.\n",
            "   “Dont tell me,” I said. “I know.”\n",
            "   “How could you?” said Bug, looking me over.\n",
            "   “The last aud-call at L. A. High, I think they played “Thanks for the Memory,” but just before that—”\n",
            "   ““Roll Out the Barrel—”\n",
            "   “-the Barrel,” yes, and there you were in front of God and everyone, jumping.”\n",
            "   “I never stopped,” said Bug, eyes shut, back in those\n",
            "   years. “Never,” he said, “stopped.”\n",
            "   “You got your life all made,” I said.\n",
            "   “Unless,” said Bug, “something happens.”\n",
            "   What happened was, of course, the war.\n",
            "   Looking back, I remember that in that last year in school, sap that I was, I made up a list of my one hundred and sixty-five best friends. Can you imagine that? One hundred and sixty-five, count “em, best friends! Its a good thing I never showed that list to anyone. I would have been hooted out of school.\n",
            "   \tAnyway, the war came and went and took with it a couple dozen of those listed friends and the rest just disappeared into holes in the ground or went east or wound up in Malibu or Fort Lauderdale. Bug was on that list, but I didnt figure out I didnt really know him until half a lifetime later. By that time I was down to half a dozen pals or women I might turn to if I needed, and it was then, walking down Hollywood Boulevard one Saturday afternoon, I heard someone call:\n",
            "   “How about a hot dog and a Coke?”\n",
            "   Bug, I thought without turning. And thats who it was, standing on the Walk of Stars with his feet planted on Mary Pickford and Ricardo Cortez just behind and Jimmy Stewart just ahead. Bug had taken off some hair and put on some weight, but it was Bug and I was overjoyed, perhaps too much, and showed it, for he seemed embarrassed at my enthusiasm. I saw then that his suit was not half new enough and his shirt frayed, but his tie was neatly tied and he shook my hand off and we popped into a place where we stood and had that hot dog and that Coke.\n",
            "   “Still going to be the worlds greatest writer?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Working at it,” I said.\n",
            "   “Youll get there,” said Bug and smiled, meaning it. “You were always good.”\n",
            "   “So were you,” I said.\n",
            "   That seemed to pain him slightly, for he stopped chewing for a moment and took a swig of Coke. “Yes, sir,” he said. “I surely was.”\n",
            "   “God,” I said, “I can still remember the day I saw all those trophies for the first time. What a family! Whatever-?”\n",
            "   Before I could finish asking, he gave the answer.\n",
            "   “Put “em in storage, some. Some wound up with my first wife. Goodwill got the rest.”\n",
            "   “Im sorry,” I said, and truly was.\n",
            "   Bug looked at me steadily. “How come youre sorry?”\n",
            "   “Hell, I dunno,” I said. “Its just, they seemed such a part of you. I havent thought of you often the last few years or so, to be honest, but when I do, there you are knee-deep in all those cups and mugs in your front room, out in the kitchen, hell, in your garage!”\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Bug. “What a memory you got.”\n",
            "   We finished our Cokes and it was almost time to go. I couldnt help myself, even seeing that Bug had fleshed himself out over the years.\n",
            "   “When—” I started to say, and stopped.\n",
            "   “When what?” said Bug.\n",
            "   “When,” I said with difficulty, “when was the last time you danced?”\n",
            "   “Years,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “But how long ago?”\n",
            "   “Ten years. Fifteen. Maybe twenty. Yeah, twenty. I dont dance anymore.”\n",
            "   “I dont believe that. Bug not dance? Nuts.”\n",
            "   “Truth. Gave my fancy night-out shoes to the Goodwill, too. Cant dance in your socks.”\n",
            "   “Can, and barefoot, too!”\n",
            "   Bug had to laugh at that. “Youre really something. Well, its been nice.” He started edging toward the door. “Take care, genius—”\n",
            "   “Not so fast.” I walked him out into the light and he was looking both ways as if there were heavy traffic. “You know one thing I never saw and wanted to see? You bragged about it, said you took three hundred ordinary girls out on the dance floor and turned them into Ginger Rogers inside three minutes. But I only saw you once at that aud-call in “38, so I dont believe you.”\n",
            "   “What?” said Bug. “You saw the trophies!”\n",
            "   “You could have had those made up,” I pursued, looking at his wrinkled suit and frayed shirt cuffs. “Anyone can go in a trophy shop and buy a cup and have his name put on it!”\n",
            "   “You think I did that?” cried Bug.\n",
            "   “I think that, yes!”\n",
            "   Bug glanced out in the street and back at me and back in the street and back to me, trying to decide which way to run or push or shout.\n",
            "   “Whats got into you?” said Bug. “Whyre you talking like that?”\n",
            "   “God, I dont know,” I admitted. “Its just, we might not meet again and Ill never have the chance, or you to prove it. Id like, after all this time, to see what you talked about. Id love to see you dance again, Bug.”\n",
            "   “Naw,” said Bug. “Ive forgotten how.”\n",
            "   “Dont hand me that. You may have forgotten, but the rest of you knows how. Bet you could go down to the Ambassador Hotel this afternoon, they still have tea dances there, and clear the floor, just like you said. After youre out there nobody else dances, they all stop and look at you and her just like thirty years ago.”\n",
            "   “No,” said Bug, backing away but coming back. “No, no.”\n",
            "   “Pick a stranger, any girl, any woman, out of the crowd, lead her out, hold her in your arms and just skim her around as if you were on ice and dream her to Paradise.”\n",
            "   “If you write like that, youll never sell,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Bet you, Bug.”\n",
            "   “I dont bet.”\n",
            "   “All right, then. Bet you you cant. Bet you, By God, that youve lost your stuff!”\n",
            "   “Now, hold on,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “I mean it. Lost your stuff forever, for good. Bet you. Wanna bet?”\n",
            "   Bugs eyes took on a peculiar shine and his face was flushed. “How much?”\n",
            "   “Fifty bucks!”\n",
            "   “I dont have—”\n",
            "   “Thirty bucks, then. Twenty! You can afford to lose that, cant you?”\n",
            "   “Who says Id lose, dammit?”\n",
            "   “I say. Twenty. Is it a deal?”\n",
            "   “Youre throwing your money away.”\n",
            "   “No, Im a sure winner, because you cant dance worth shoats and shinola!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your money?” cried Bug, incensed now.\n",
            "   “Here!”\n",
            "   “Wheres your car!?”\n",
            "   “I dont own a car. Never learned to drive. Wheres yours?”\n",
            "   “Sold it! Jesus, no cars. How do we get to the tea dance!?” We got. We grabbed a cab and I paid and, before Bug could relent, dragged him through the hotel lobby and into the ballroom. It was a nice summer afternoon, so nice that the room was filled with mostly middle-aged men and their wives, a few younger ones with their girlfriends, and some kids out of college who looked out of place, embarrassed by the mostly old-folks music out of another time. We got the last table and when Bug opened his mouth for one last protest, I put a straw in it and helped him nurse a marguerita.\n",
            "   “Why are you doing this?” he protested again.\n",
            "   “Because you were just one of one hundred sixty-five close friends!” I said.\n",
            "   “We were never friends,” said Bug.\n",
            "   “Well, today, anyway. Theres “Moonlight Serenade. “Always liked that, never danced myself, clumsy fool. On your feet, Bug!”\n",
            "   He was on his feet, swaying.\n",
            "   “Who do you pick?” I said. “You cut in on a couple? Or theres a few wallflowers over there, a tableful of women. I dare you to pick the least likely and give her lessons, yes?”\n",
            "   That did it. Casting me a glance of the purest scorn, he charged off half into the pretty teatime dresses and immaculate men, searching around until his eyes lit on a table where a woman of indeterminate age sat, hands folded, face thin and sickly pale, half hidden under a wide-brimmed hat, looking as if she were waiting for someone who never came.\n",
            "   That one, I thought.\n",
            "   Bug glanced from her to me. I nodded. And in a moment he was bowing at her table and a conversation ensued. It seemed she didnt dance, didnt know how to dance, didnt want to dance. Ah, yes, he seemed to be saying. Ah, no, she seemed to reply. Bug turned, holding her hand, and gave me a long stare and a wink. Then, without looking at her, he raised her by her hand and arm and out, with a seamless glide, onto the floor.\n",
            "   What can I say, how can I tell? Bug, long ago, had never bragged, but only told the truth. Once he got hold of a girl, she was weightless. By the time he had whisked and whirled and glided her once around the floor, she almost took off, it seemed he had to hold her down, she was pure gossamer, the closest thing to a hummingbird held in the hand so you cannot feel its weight but only sense its heartbeat sounding to your touch, and there she went out and around and back, with Bug guiding and moving, enticing and retreating, and not fifty anymore, no, but eighteen, his body remembering what his mind thought it had long forgotten, for his body was free of the earth now, too. He carried himself, as he carried her, with that careless insouciance of a lover who knows what will happen in the  hour and the night soon following.\n",
            "   And it happened, just like he said. Within a minute, a minute and a half at most, the dance floor cleared. As Bug and his stranger lady whirled by with a glance, every couple on the floor stood still. The bandleader almost forgot to keep time with his baton, and the members of the orchestra, in a similar trance, leaned forward over their instruments to see Bug and his new love whirl and turn without touching the floor.\n",
            "   When the “Serenade” ended, there was a moment of stillness and then an explosion of applause. Bug pretended it was all for the lady, and helped her curtsy and took her to her table, where she sat, eyes shut, not believing what had happened. By that time Bug was on the floor again, with one of the wives he borrowed from the nearest table. This time, no one even went out on the floor. Bug and the borrowed wife filled it around and around, and this time even Bugs eyes were shut.\n",
            "   I got up and put twenty dollars on the table where he might find it. After all, he had won the bet, hadnt he?\n",
            "   Why had I done it? Well, I couldnt very well have left him out in the middle of the high school auditorium aisle dancing alone, could I?\n",
            "   On my way out I looked back. Bug saw me and waved, his eyes as brimmed full as mine. Someone passing whispered, “Hey, come on, lookit this guy!”\n",
            "   God, I thought, hell be dancing all night.\n",
            "   Me, I could only walk.\n",
            "   And I went out and walked until I was fifty again and the sun was going down and the low June fog was coming in early over old Los Angeles.\n",
            "   That night, just before going to sleep, I wished that in the morning when Bug woke up he would find the floor around his bed covered with trophies.\n",
            "   Or at the very least he would turn and find a quiet and understanding trophy with her head on his pillow, near enough to touch.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "ONCE MORE, LEGATO\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine autumn and listened. The drink in his hand remained unsipped, his friend Black unspoken to, the fine house unnoticed, the very weather itself neglected, for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above them.\n",
            "   “My God,” he mid. “Do you “hear?”\n",
            "   “What, the birds?” asked his friend Black, doing just the opposite, sipping his drink, noticing the weather, admiring the rich house, and neglecting the birds entirely until this moment.\n",
            "   “Great God in heaven, listen to them!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   Black listened. “Rather nice.”\n",
            "   “clean out your ears!”\n",
            "   Black made a halfhearted gesture, symbolizing the cleaning out of ears. “Well?”\n",
            "   “Damn it, dont be funny. I mean really listen! Theyre singing a tune!”\n",
            "   “Birds usually do.”\n",
            "   “No, they dont; birds paste together bits and pieces maybe, five or six notes, eight at the most. Mockingbirds have repertoires that change, but not entire melodies. These birds are different. Now shut up and give over!”\n",
            "   Both men sat, enchanted. Blacks expression melted.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” he said at last. “They do go on.” He leaned forward and listened intently.\n",
            "   “Yes...” murmured Fentriss, eyes shut, nodding to the rhythms that sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads. “... ohmigod... indeed.”\n",
            "   Black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up. Fentriss protested with a fierce whisper:\n",
            "   “Dont spoil it. Sit. Be very still. Wheres my pencil? Ah...”\n",
            "   Half peering around, he found a pencil and notepad, shut his eyes, and began to scribble blindly.\n",
            "   The birds sang.\n",
            "   “Youre not actually writing down their song?” said Black.\n",
            "   “What does it look like? Quiet.”\n",
            "   And with eyes now open, now shut, Fentriss drew scales and jammed in the notes.\n",
            "   “I didnt know you read music,” said Black, astonished.\n",
            "   “I played the violin until my father broke it. Please! There. There. Yes!\n",
            "   “Slower,” he whispered. “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   As if hearing, the birds adjusted their lilt, moving toward piano instead of bravado.\n",
            "   A breeze stirred the leaves, like an invisible conductor, and the singing died.\n",
            "   Fentriss, perspiration beading his forehead, stopped scribbling and fell back.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned.” Black gulped his drink. “What was that all about?”\n",
            "   “Writing a song.” Fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper. “Or a tone poem.”\n",
            "   “Let me see that!”\n",
            "   “Wait.” The tree shook itself gently, but produced no further notes. “I want to be sure theyre done.”\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Black seized the pages and let his eyes drift over the scales. “Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,” he said, aghast. “It works.” He glanced up at the thick green of the tree, where no throat warbled, no wing stirred. “What kind of birds are those?”\n",
            "   “The birds of forever, the small beasts of an Immaculate Musical Conception. Something,” said Fentriss, “has made them with child and its name is song—”\n",
            "   “Hogwash!”\n",
            "   “Is it?! Something in the air, in the seeds they ate at dawn, some whim of climate and weather, God! But now theyre mine, its mine. A fine tune.”\n",
            "   “It is” said Black. “But cant be!”\n",
            "   “Never question the miraculous when it happens. Good grief, maybe those damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible songs for months, years, but no one listened. Today, for the first time, someone did. Me! Now, what to do with the gift?”\n",
            "   “You dont seriously mean-?”\n",
            "   “Ive been out of work for a year. I quit my computers, retired early, Im only forty-nine, and have been threatening to knit macrame” to give friends to spoil their walls, day after day. Which shall it be, friend, macrame” or Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Are you Mozart?”\n",
            "   “Just his bastard son.”\n",
            "   “Nonsense,” cried Black, pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the trees as if he might blast the choir. “That tree, those birds, are a Rorschach test. Your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from pure chaos. Theres no discernible tune, no special rhythm. You had me fooled, but I see and hear it now: youve had a repressed desire since childhood to compose. And youve let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by the ears. Put down that pen!”\n",
            "   “Nonsense right back at you.” Fentriss laughed. “Youre jealous that after twelve layabout years, thunderstruck with boredom, one of us has found an occupation. I shall follow it. Listen and write, write and listen. Sit down, youre obstructing the acoustics!”\n",
            "   “Ill sit,” Black exclaimed, “but—” He clapped his hands over his ears.\n",
            "   “Fair enough,” said Fentriss. “Escape fantastic reality while I change a few notes and finish out this unexpected birth.”\n",
            "   Glancing up at the tree, he whispered:\n",
            "   “Wait for me.”\n",
            "   The tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet.\n",
            "   “Crazy,” muttered Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   One, two, three hours later, entering the library quietly and then loudly, Black cried out:\n",
            "   “What are you doing?”\n",
            "   Bent over his desk, his hand moving furiously, Fentriss said:\n",
            "   “Finishing a symphony!”\n",
            "   “The same one you began in the garden?”\n",
            "   “No, the birds began, the birds!”\n",
            "   “The birds, then.” Black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions. “How do you know what to do with that stuff?”\n",
            "   “They did most. Ive added variations!”\n",
            "   “An arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack. Have you composed before?”\n",
            "   “Not”-Fentriss let his fingers roam, loop, and scratch-“until today!”\n",
            "   “You realize, of course, youre plagiarizing those songbirds?”\n",
            "   “Borrowing, Black, borrowing. If a milkmaid, singing at dawn, can have her hum borrowed by Berlioz, well! Or if Dvorak, hearing a Dixie banjo plucker pluck “Goin” Home,” steals the banjo to eke out his New World, why cant I weave a net to catch a tune? There! Finito. Done! Give us a title, Black!”\n",
            "   “I? Who sings off-key?”\n",
            "   “What about “The Emperors Nightingale”?”\n",
            "   “Stravinsky.”\n",
            "   “The Birds”?”\n",
            "   “Hitchcock.”\n",
            "   “Damn. Hows this: “Its Only John Cage in a Gilded Bird”?”\n",
            "   “Brilliant. But no one knows who John Cage was.”\n",
            "   “Well, then, Ive got it!” And he wrote:\n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies Baked in a Pie.”\n",
            "   “Blackbirds, you mean; go back to John Cage.”\n",
            "   “Bosh!” Fentriss stabbed the phone. “Hello, Willie? Could you come over? Yes, a small job. Symphonic arrangement for a friend, or friends. Whats your usual Philharmonic fee? Eh? Good enough. Tonight!”\n",
            "   Fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonder in it.\n",
            "   “What ?” he murmured.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   “Forty-seven Magpies,” with title shortened, premiered at the Glendale Chamber Symphony a month later with standing ovations, incredible reviews.\n",
            "   Fentriss, outside his skin with joy, prepared to launch himself atop large, small, symphonic, operatic, whatever fell on his ears. He had listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks, but bad noted nothing, waiting to see if the “Magpie” experiment was to be repeated. When the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they werent skipping, he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy ceased.\n",
            "   There followed: “Wings,” “Flight,” “Night Chorus,” “The Fledgling Madrigals,” and “Dawn Patrol,” each greeted by new thunderstorms of acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise.\n",
            "   “By now,” said Fentriss, “I should be unbearable to live with, but the birds caution modesty.”\n",
            "   “Also,” said Black, seated under the tree, waiting for a sprig of benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna, “shut up! If all those sly dimwit composers, who will soon be lurking in the bushes, cop your secret, youre a gone poacher.”\n",
            "   “Poacher! By God, yes!” Fentriss laughed. “Poacher.”\n",
            "   And damn if the first poacher didnt arrive!\n",
            "   Glancing out at tree in the morning, Fentriss witnessed a runty shadow stretching up, handheld tape recorder poised, warbling and whistling softly at the tree. when this failed, the half-seen poacher tried dove-coos and then orioles and roosters, half dancing in a circle.\n",
            "   “Damn it to hell!” Fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry: “Is that Wolfgang Prouty poaching my garden? Out, Wolfgang! Go!”\n",
            "   Dropping his recorder, Prouty vaulted a bush, impaled himself on thorns, and vanished.\n",
            "   Fentriss, cursing, picked up an abandoned notepad.\n",
            "   “Nightsong,” it read. On the tape recorder he found a lovely Satie-like bird-choir.\n",
            "   After that, more poachers arrived mid-night to depart at dawn. Their spawn, Fentriss realized, would soon throttle his creativity and still his voice. He loitered full-time in the garden now, not knowing what seed to give his beauties, and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up worms. Wearily he stood guard through sleepless nights, nodding off only to find Wolfgang Proutys evil minions astride the wall, prompting arias, and one night, by God, perched in the tree itself, humming in hopes of sing-alongs.\n",
            "   A shotgun was the final answer. After its first fiery roar, the garden was empty for a week. That is, until-\tSomeone came very late indeed and committed mayhem.\n",
            "   As quietly as possible, he cut the branches and sawed the limbs.\n",
            "   “Oh, envious composers, dreadful murderers!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   And the birds were gone.\n",
            "   And the career of Amadeus Two with it.\n",
            "   “Black!” cried Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Yes, dear friend?” said Black, looking at the bleak sky where once green was.\n",
            "   “Is your car outside?”\n",
            "   “When last I looked.”\n",
            "   “Drive!”\n",
            "   But driving in search didnt do it. It wasnt like calling in lost dogs or telephone-poled cats. They must find and cage an entire Mormon tabernacle team of soprano springtime-in-the-Rockies birdseed lovers to prove one in the hand is worth two in the bush.\n",
            "   But still they hastened from block to block, garden to garden, lurking and listening. Now their spirits soared with an echo of “Hallelujah Chorus” oriole warbling, only to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of despair.\n",
            "   Only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt and greens did one of them finally (Black) light his pipe and emit a theory.\n",
            "   “Did you ever think to wonder,” he mused behind a smoke-cloud, “what season of the year this is?”\n",
            "   “Season of the year?” said Fentriss, exasperated.\n",
            "   “Well, coincidentally, wasnt the night the tree fell and the wee songsters blew town, was not that the first fall night of autumn?”\n",
            "   Fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow.\n",
            "   “You mean?”\n",
            "   “Your friends have flown the coop. Their migration must be above San Miguel Allende just now.”\n",
            "   “If they are migratory birds!”\n",
            "   “Do you doubt it?”\n",
            "   Another pained silence, another blow to the head.\n",
            "   “Shit!”\n",
            "   “Precisely,” said Black.\n",
            "   “Friend,” said Fentriss.\n",
            "   “Sir?”\n",
            "   “Drive home.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   It was a long year, it was a short year, it was a year of anticipation, it was the burgeoning of despair, it was the revival of inspiration, but at its heart, Fentriss knew, just another Tale of Two Cities, but he did not know what the other city was!\n",
            "   How stupid of me, he thought, not to have guessed or imagined that my songsters were wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime swarmed north in A Cappella choirs of sound.\n",
            "   “The waiting,” he told Black, “is madness. The phone never stops—”\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up and addressed it like a child. “Yes. Yes. Of course. Soon. When? Very soon.” And put the phone down. “You see? That was Philadelphia. They want another Cantata as good as the first. At dawn today it was Boston. Yesterday the Vienna Philharmonic. Soon, I say. When? God knows. Lunacy! Where are those angels that once sang me to my rest?”\n",
            "   He threw down maps and weather charts of Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and the Argentines.\n",
            "   “How far south? Do I scour Buenos Aires or Rio, Mazatlan or Cuernavaca? And then? Wander about with a tin ear, standing under trees waiting for bird-drops like a spotted owl? Will the Argentine critics trot by scoffing to see me leaning on trees, eyes shut, waiting for the quasi-melody, the lost chord? Id let no one know the cause of my journey, my search, otherwise pandemoniums of laughter. But in what city, under what kind of tree would I wander to stand? A tree like mine? Do they seek the same roosts? or will anything do in Ecuador or Peru? God, I could waste months guessing and come back with birdseed in my hair and bird bombs on my lapels. What to do, Black? Speak!”\n",
            "   “Well, for one thing”-Black stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his aromatic concepts—” “you might clear off this stump and plant a new tree.”\n",
            "   They had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration. Fentriss froze with one foot raised. “Say that again?!”\n",
            "   “I said—”\n",
            "   “Good grief, you genius! Let me kiss you!”\n",
            "   “Rather not. Hugs, maybe.”\n",
            "   Fentriss hugged him, wildly. “Friend!”\n",
            "   “Always was.”\n",
            "   “Lets get a shovel and spade.”\n",
            "   “You get. Ill watch.”\n",
            "   Fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax.\n",
            "   “Sure you wont join me?”\n",
            "   Black sucked his pipe, blew smoke. “Later.”\n",
            "   “How much would a full-grown tree cost?”\n",
            "   “Too much.”\n",
            "   “Yes, but if it were here and the birds did return?” Black let out more smoke. “Might be worth it. Opus Number Two: “In the Beginning” by Charles Fentriss, stuff like that.”\n",
            "   “In the Beginning,” or maybe “The Return. “”\n",
            "   “One of those.”\n",
            "   “Or—” Fentriss struck the stump with the pickax. ““Rebirth. ““He struck again. “Ode to Joy. ““Another strike.\n",
            "   “Spring Harvest. ““Another. “Let the Heavens Resound. “Hows that, Black?”\n",
            "   “I prefer the other,” said Black.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   The stump was pulled and the new tree bought.\n",
            "   “Dont show me the bill,” Fentriss told his accountant. “Pay it.”\n",
            "   And the tallest tree they could find, of the same family as the one dead and gone, was planted.\n",
            "   “What if it dies before my choir returns?” said Fentriss. “What if it lives,” said Black, “and your choir goes elsewhere?”\n",
            "   The tree, planted, seemed in no immediate need to die. Neither did it look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far southern places.\n",
            "   Meanwhile, the sky, like the tree, was empty. “Dont they know Im waiting?” said Fentriss. “Not unless,” offered Black, “you majored in cross-continental telepathy.”\n",
            "   “Ive checked with Audubon. They say that while the swallows do come back to Capistrano on a special day, give or take a white lie, other migrating species are often one or two weeks late.”\n",
            "   “If I were you,” said Black, “I would plunge into an intense love affair to distract you while you wait.”\n",
            "   “I am fresh out of love affairs.”\n",
            "   “Well, then,” said Black, “suffer.”\n",
            "   The hours passed slower than the minutes, the days passed slower than the hours, the weeks passed slower than the days. Black called. “No birds?”\n",
            "   “No birds.”\n",
            "   “Pity. I cant stand watching you lose weight.” And Black disconnected.\n",
            "   On a final night, when Fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the wall, fearful of another call from the Boston Symphony, he leaned an ax against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky.\n",
            "   “Last chance,” he said. “If the dawn patrol doesnt show by seven a. m., its quits.”\n",
            "   And he touched ax-blade against the tree-bole, took two shots of vodka so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes, and went to bed.\n",
            "   He awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze outside his window, stirring the leaves, with not a ghost of song.\n",
            "   And awoke at dawn with tear-filled eyes, having dreamed that the birds had returned, but knew, in waking, it was only a dream.\n",
            "   And yet...?\n",
            "   Hark, someone might have said in an old novel. List! as in an old play.\n",
            "   Eyes shut, he fine-tuned his ears .\n",
            "   The tree outside, as he arose, looked fatter, as if it had taken on invisible ballasts in the night. There were stirrings there, not of simple breeze or probing winds, but of something in the very leaves that knitted and purled them in rhythms. He dared not look but lay back down to ache his senses and try to know.\n",
            "   A single chirp hovered in the window.\n",
            "   He waited.\n",
            "   Silence.\n",
            "   Go on, he thought.\n",
            "   Another chirp.\n",
            "   Dont breathe, he thought; dont let them know youre listening.\n",
            "   Hush.\n",
            "   A fourth sound, then a fifth note, then a sixth and seventh. My God, he thought, is this a substitute orchestra, a replacement choir come to scare off my loves?\n",
            "   Another five notes.\n",
            "   Perhaps, he prayed, theyre only tuning up!\n",
            "   Another twelve notes, of no special timbre or pace, and as he was about to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunch-It happened. Note after note, line after line, fluid melody following spring freshet melody, the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous proclamations of return and welcome in chorus.\n",
            "   And as they sang, Fentriss sneaked his hand to find a pad and pen to hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir that soared and dipped to soar again, firing the bright air that flowed from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to remember.\n",
            "   The phone rang. He picked it up swiftly to hear Black ask\n",
            "   if the waiting was over. Without speaking, he held the receiver in the window.\n",
            "   “Ill be damned,” said Blacks voice.\n",
            "   “No, anointed,” whispered the composer, scribbling Cantata No. 2. Laughing, he called softly to the sky.\n",
            "   “Please. More slowly. Legato, not agitato.”\n",
            "   And the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed.\n",
            "   Agitato ceased.\n",
            "   Legato prevailed.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "EXCHANGE\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There were too many cards in the file, too many books on the shelves, too many children laughing in the childrens room, too many newspapers to fold and stash on the racks... \n",
            "   All in all, too much. Miss Adams pushed her gray hair back over her lined brow, adjusted her gold-rimmed pince-nez, and rang the small silver bell on the library desk, at the same time switching off and on all the lights. The exodus of adults and children was exhausting. Miss Ingraham, the assistant librarian, had gone home early because her father was sick, so it left the burden of stamping, filing, and checking books squarely on Miss Adams” shoulders.\n",
            "   Finally the last book was stamped, the last child fed through the great brass doors, the doors locked, and with immense weariness, Miss Adams moved back up through a silence of forty years of books and being keeper of the books, stood for a long moment by the main desk.\n",
            "   She laid her glasses down on the green blotter, and pressed the bridge of her small-boned nose between thumb and forefinger and held it, eyes shut. What a racket! Children who finger-painted or cartooned frontispieces or rattled their roller skates. High school students arriving with laughters, departing with mindless songs!\n",
            "   Taking up her rubber stamp, she probed the files, weeding out errors, her fingers whispering between Dante and Darwin.\n",
            "   A moment later she heard the rapping on the front-door glass and saw a mans shadow outside, wanting in. She shook her head. The figure pleaded silently, making gestures.\n",
            "   Sighing, Miss Adams opened the door, saw a young man in uniform, and said, “Its late. Were closed.” She glanced at his insignia and added, “Captain.”\n",
            "   “Hold on!” said the captain. “Remember me?”\n",
            "   And repeated it, as she hesitated.\n",
            "   “Remember?”\n",
            "   She studied his face, trying to bring light out of shadow. “Yes, I think I do,” she said at last. “You once borrowed books here.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Many years ago,” she added. “Now I almost have you placed.”\n",
            "   As he stood waiting she tried to see him in those other years, but his younger face did not come clear, or a name with it, and his hand reached out now to take hers.\n",
            "   “May I come in?”\n",
            "   “Well.” She hesitated. “Yes.”\n",
            "   She led the way up the steps into the immense twilight of books. The young officer looked around and let his breath out slowly, then reached to take a book and hold it to his nose, inhaling, then almost laughing.\n",
            "   “Dont mind me, Miss Adams. You ever smell new books? Binding, pages, print. Like fresh bread when youre hungry.” He glanced around. “Im hungry now, but dont even know what for.”\n",
            "   There was a moment of silence, so she asked him how long he might stay.\n",
            "   “Just a few hours. Im on the train from New York to L. A., so I came up from Chicago to see old places, old friends.” His eyes were troubled and he fretted his cap, turning it in his long, slender fingers.\n",
            "   She said gently, “Is anything wrong? Anything I can help you with?”\n",
            "   He glanced out the window at the dark town, with just a few lights in the windows of the small houses across the way.\n",
            "   “I was surprised,” he said.\n",
            "   “By what?”\n",
            "   “I dont know what I expected. Pretty damn dumb,” he said, looking from her to the windows, “to expect that when I went away, everyone froze in place waiting for me to come home. That when I stepped off the train, all my old pals would unfreeze, run down, meet me at the station. Silly.”\n",
            "   “No,” she said, more easily now. “I think we all imagine that. I visited Paris as a young girl, went back to France when I was forty, and was outraged that no one had waited, buildings had vanished, and all the hotel staff where I had once lived had died, retired, or traveled.”\n",
            "   He nodded at this, but could not seem to go on.\n",
            "   “Did anyone know you were coming?” she asked.\n",
            "   “I wrote a few, but no answers. I figured, hell, theyre busy, but theyll be there. They werent.”\n",
            "   She felt the  words come off her lips and was faintly surprised. “Im still here,” she said.\n",
            "   “You are,” he said with a quick smile. “And I cant tell you how glad I am.”\n",
            "   He was gazing at her now with such intensity that she had to look away. “You know,” she said, “I must confess you look familiar, but I dont quite fit your face with the boy who came here—”\n",
            "   “Twenty years ago! And as for what he looked like, that other one, me, well—”\n",
            "   He brought out a smallish wallet which held a dozen pictures and handed over a photograph of a boy perhaps twelve years old, with an impish smile and wild blond hair, looking as if he might catapult out of the frame.\n",
            "   “Ah, yes.” Miss Adams adjusted her pince-nez and closed her eyes to remember. “That one. Spaulding. William Henry Spaulding?”\n",
            "   He nodded and peered at the picture in her hands anxiously.\n",
            "   “Was I a lot of trouble?”\n",
            "   “Yes.” She nodded and held the picture closer and glanced up at him. “A fiend.” She handed the picture back. “But I loved you.”\n",
            "   “Did you?” he said and smiled more broadly.\n",
            "   “In spite of you, yes.”\n",
            "   He waited a moment and then said, “Do you still love me?”\n",
            "   She looked to left and right as if the dark stacks held the answer.\n",
            "   “Its a little early to know, isnt it?”\n",
            "   “Forgive.”\n",
            "   “No, no, a good question. Time will tell. Lets not stand like your frozen friends who didnt move. Come along. Ive just had some late-night coffee. There may be some left. Give me your cap. Take off that coat. The file index is there. Go look up your old library cards for the hell-heck-of it.”\n",
            "   “Are they still there?” In amaze.\n",
            "   “Librarians save everything. You never know whos coming in on the  train. Go.”\n",
            "   When she came back with the coffee, he stood staring down into the index file like a bird fixing its gaze on a half-empty nest. He handed her one of the old purple-stamped cards.\n",
            "   “Migawd,” he said, “I took out a lot of books.”\n",
            "   “Ten at a time. I said no, but you took them. And,” she added, “read them! Here.” She put his cup on top of the file and waited while he drew out canceled card after card and laughed quietly.\n",
            "   “I cant believe. I must not have lived anywhere else but here. May I take this with me, to sit?” He showed the cards. She nodded. “Can you show me around? I mean, maybe Ive forgotten something.”\n",
            "   She shook her head and took his elbow. “I doubt that. Come on. Over here, of course, is the adult section.”\n",
            "   “I begged you to let me cross over when I was thirteen. “Youre not ready,” you said. But—”\n",
            "   “I let you cross over anyway?”\n",
            "   “You did. And much thanks.”\n",
            "   Another thought came to him as he looked down at her.\n",
            "   “You used to be taller than me,” he said.\n",
            "   She looked up at him, amused.\n",
            "   “Ive noticed that happens quite often in my life, but I can still do this.”\n",
            "   Before he could move, she grabbed his chin in her thumb and forefinger and held tight. His eyes rolled.\n",
            "   He said:\n",
            "   “I remember. When I was really bad youd hold on and put your face down close and scowl. The scowl did it. After ten seconds of your holding my chin very tight, I behaved for days.”\n",
            "   She nodded, released his chin. He rubbed it and as they moved on he ducked his head, not looking at her.\n",
            "   “Forgive, I hope you wont be upset, but when I was a boy I used to look up and see you behind your desk, so near but far away, and, how can I say this, I used to think that you were Mrs. God, and that the library was a whole world, and that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing I wanted to see and read, youd find and give it to me.” He stopped, his face coloring. “You did, too. You had the world ready for me every time I asked. There was always a place I hadnt seen, a country I hadnt visited where you took me. Ive never forgotten.”\n",
            "   She looked around, slowly, at the thousands of books. She felt her heart move quietly. “Did you really call me what you just said?”\n",
            "   “Mrs. God? Oh, yes. Often. Always.”\n",
            "   “Come along,” she said at last.\n",
            "   They walked around the rooms together and then downstairs to the newspaper files, and coming back up, he suddenly leaned against the banister, holding tight.\n",
            "   “Miss Adams,” he said.\n",
            "   “What is it, Captain?”\n",
            "   He exhaled. “Im scared. I dont want to leave. Im afraid.”\n",
            "   Her hand, all by itself, took his arm and she finally said, there in the shadows, “Sometimes-Im afraid, too. What frightens you?”\n",
            "   “I dont want to go away without saying good-bye. If I never return, I want to see all my friends, shake hands, slap them on the back, I dont know, make jokes.” He stopped and waited, then went on. “But I walk around town and nobody knows me. Everyones gone.”\n",
            "   The pendulum on the wall clock slid back and forth, shining, with the merest of sounds.\n",
            "   Hardly knowing where she was going, Miss Adams took his arm and guided him up the last steps, away from the marble vaults below, to a final, brightly decorated room, where he glanced around and shook his head.\n",
            "   “Theres no one here, either.”\n",
            "   “Do you believe that?”\n",
            "   “Well, where are they? Do any of my old pals ever come visit, borrow books, bring them back late?”\n",
            "   “Not often,” she said. “But listen. Do you realize Thomas Wolfe was wrong?”\n",
            "   “Wolfe? The great literary beast? Wrong?”\n",
            "   “The title of one of his books.”\n",
            "   “You Cant Go Home Again?” he guessed.\n",
            "   “Thats it. He was wrong. This is home. Your friends are still here. This was your summer place.”\n",
            "   “Yes. Myths. Legends. Mummies. Aztec kings. Wicked sisters who spat toads. Where I really lived. But I dont see my people.”\n",
            "   “Well.”\n",
            "   And before he could speak, she switched on a green-shaded lamp that shed a private light on a small table.\n",
            "   “Isnt this nice?” she said. “Most libraries today, too much light. There should be shadows, dont you think? Some mystery, yes? So that late nights the beasts can prowl out of the stacks and crouch by this jungle light to turn the pages with their breath. Am I crazy?”\n",
            "   “Not that I noticed.”\n",
            "   “Good. Sit. Now that I know who you are, it all comes back.”\n",

            "   “No? Youll see.”\n",
            "   She vanished into the stacks and came out with ten books that she placed upright, their pages a trifle spread so they could stand and he could read the titles.\n",

            "   “Oz? Dorothy? The Wizard? Oh, yes.”\n",
            "   She placed still others nearby. “Alice in Wonderland. Through the Looking-Glass. A month later you reborrowed both. “But,” I said, “youve already read them!” “But,” you said, “not enough so I can speak. I want to be able to tell them out loud.”\n",
            "   “My God,” he said quietly, “did I say that?”\n",
            "   “You did. Heres more you read a dozen times. Greek myths, Roman, Egyptian. Norse myths, Chinese. You were ravenous.”\n",

            "   “Three dozen times! John Carter, Warlord of Mars, four dozen. My God, dear lady, how come you remember all this?”\n",
            "   “You never left. Summertimes you were here when I unlocked the doors. You went home for lunch but sometimes brought sandwiches and sat out by the stone lion at noon. Your father pulled you home by your ear some nights when you stayed late. How could I forget a boy like that?”\n",
            "   “But still—”\n",
            "   “You never played, never ran out in baseball weather, or football, I imagine. Why?”\n",
            "   He glanced toward the front door. “They were waiting for me.”\n",
            "   “They?”\n",
            "   “You know. The ones who never borrowed books, never read. They. Them. Those.”\n",
            "   She looked and remembered. “Ah, yes. The bullies. Why did they chase you?”\n",
            "   “Because they knew I loved books and didnt much care for them.”\n",
            "   “Its a wonder you survived. I used to watch you getting, reading hunchbacked, late afternoons. You looked so lonely.”\n",
            "   “No. I had these. Company.”\n",
            "   “Heres more.”\n",
            "   She put down Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and Treasure Island.\n",
            "   “Oh,” he said, “and dear and strange Mr. Poe. How I loved his Red Death.”\n",
            "   “You took it so often I told you to keep it on permanent loan unless someone else asked. Someone did, six months later, and when you brought it in I could see it was a terrible blow. A few days later I let you have Poe for another year. I dont recall, did you ever-?”\n",
            "   “Its out in California. Shall I—”\n",
            "   “No, no. Please. Well, here are your books. Let me bring others.”\n",

            "   She began to make a circle inside the other Stonehenge circle and as she placed the books, in lonely splendor, he said their names and then the names of the authors who had written them and then the names of those who had sat across from him so many years ago and read the books quietly or sometimes whispered the finest parts aloud, so beautifully that no one said Quiet or Silence or even Shh!\n",
            "   She placed the first book and there was a wild field of broom and a wind blowing a young woman across that field as it began to snow and someone, far away, called “Kathy” and as the snows fell he saw a girl he had walked to school in the sixth grade seated across the table, her eyes fixed to the windblown field and the snow and the lost woman in another time of winter.\n",
            "   A second book was set in place and a black and beauteous horse raced across a summer field of green and on that horse was another girl, who hid behind the book and dared to pass him notes when he was twelve.\n",
            "   And then there was the far ghost with a snow-maiden face whose hair was a long golden harp played by the summer airs; she who was always sailing to Byzantium where Emperors were drowsed by golden birds that sang in clockwork cages at sunset and dawn. She who always skirted the outer rim of school and went to swim in the deep lake ten thousand afternoons ago and never came out, so was never found, but suddenly now she made landfall here in the green-shaded light and opened Yeats to at last sail home from Byzantium.\n",
            "   And on her right: John Huff, whose name came clearer than the rest, who claimed to have climbed every tree in town and fallen from none, who had raced through watermelon patches treading melons, never touching earth, to knock down rainfalls of chestnuts with one blow, who yodeled at your sun-up window and wrote the same Mark Twain book report in four different grades before the teachers caught on, at which he said, vanishing, “Just call me Huck.”\n",
            "   And to his right, the pale son of the town hotel owner who looked as if he had gone sleepless forever, who swore every empty house was haunted and took you there to prove it, with a juicy tongue, compressed nose, and throat gargling that sounded the long October demise, the terrible and unutterable fall of the House of Usher.\n",
            "   And  to him was yet another girl.\n",
            "   And  to her... \n",
            "   And just beyond... \n",
            "   Miss Adams placed a final book and he recalled the fair creature, long ago, when such things were left unsaid, glancing up at him one day when he was an unknowing twelve and she was a wise thirteen to quietly say: “I am Beauty. And you, are you the Beast?”\n",
            "   Now, late in time, he wanted to answer that small and wondrous ghost: “No. He hides in the stacks and when the clock strikes three, will prowl forth to drink.”\n",
            "   And it was finished, all the books were placed, the outer ring of his selves and the inner ring of remembered faces, deathless, with summer and autumn names.\n",
            "   He sat for a long moment and then another long moment and then, one by one, reached for and took all of the books that had been his, and still were, and opened them and read and shut them and took another until he reached the end of the outer circle and then went to touch and turn and find the raft on the river, the field of broom where the storms lived, and the pasture with the black and beauteous horse and its lovely rider. Behind him, he heard the lady librarian quietly back away to leave him with words .\n",
            "   A long while later he sat back, rubbed his yes, and looked around at the fortress, the encirclement, the Roman encampment of books, and nodded, his eyes wet.\n",
            "   “Yes.”\n",
            "   He heard her move behind him.\n",

            "   “Nothing will as long as I can help it,,, she said.\n",
            "   “Dont ever go away.”\n",
            "   “I wont if youll come back more often.”\n",
            "   Just then, from below the town, not so very far off, a train whistle blew. She said:\n",
            "   “Is that yours?”\n",
            "   “No, but the one soon after,” he said and got up and moved around the small monuments that stood very tall and one by one, shut the covers, his lips moving to sound the old titles and the old, dear names.\n",
            "   “Do we have to put them back on the shelves?” he said. She looked at him and at the double circle and after a long moment said, “Tomorrow will do. Why?”\n",
            "   “Maybe,” he said, “during the night, because of the color of those lamps, green, the jungle, maybe those creatures you mentioned will come out and turn the pages with their breath. And maybe—”\n",
            "   “What else?”\n",
            "   “Maybe my friends, whove hid in the stacks all these years, will come out, too. “,\n",
            "   “Theyre already here,” she said quietly.\n",
            "   “Yes.” He nodded. “They are.”\n",
            "   And still he could not move.\n",
            "   She backed off across the room without making any sound, and when she reached her desk she called back, the last call of the night.\n",
            "   “Closing time. Closing time, children.”\n",
            "   And turned the lights quickly off and then on and then halfway between; a library twilight.\n",
            "   He moved from the table with the double circle of books and came to her and said, “I Can go now.”\n",
            "   “Yes,” she said. “William Henry Spaulding. You can.” They walked together as she turned out the lights, turned out the lights, one by one. She helped him into his coat and\n",
            "   then, hardly thinking to do so, he took her hand and kissed her fingers.\n",
            "   It was so abrupt, she almost laughed, but then she said, “Remember what Edith Whanon said when Henry James did what you just did?”\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “The flavor starts at the elbow.”\n",
            "   They broke into laughter together and he turned and went down the marble steps toward the stained-glass entry. At the bottom of the stairs he looked up at her and said:\n",
            "   “Tonight, when youre going to sleep, remember what I called you when I was twelve, and say it out loud.”\n",
            "   “I dont remember,” she said.\n",
            "   “Yes, you do.”\n",
            "   Below the town, a train whistle blew again.\n",
            "   He opened the front door, stepped out, and he was gone. Her hand on the last light switch, looking in at the double circle of books on the far table, she thought: What was it he called me?\n",
            "   “Oh, yes,” she said a moment later.\n",
            "   And switched off the light.\n",

            "   The cemetery was in the center of the city. On four sides it was bounded by gliding streetcars on glistening blue tracks and cars with exhaust fumes and sound. But, once inside the wall, the world was lost. For half a mile in four directions the cemetery raised midnight trees and headstones that grew from the earth, like pale mushrooms, moist and cold. A gravel path led back into darkness and within the gate stood a Gothic Victorian house with six gables and a cupola. The front-porch light showed an old man there alone, not smoking, not reading, not moving, silent. If you took a deep breath he smelled of the sea, of urine, of papyrus, of kindling, of ivory, and of teak. His false teeth moved his mouth automatically when it wanted to talk. His tiny yellow seed eyes twitched and his poke-hole nostrils thinned as a stranger crunched up the gravel path and set foot on the porch step.\n",
            "   “Good evening!” said the stranger, a young man, perhaps twenty.\n",
            "   The old man nodded, but his hands lay quietly on his knees “I saw that sign out front,” the stranger went on. “FREE DIRT, it said.”\n",
            "   The old man almost nodded.\n",
            "   The stranger tried a smile. “Crazy, but that sign caught my eye.\n",
            "   There was a glass fan over the front door. A light shone through this glass fan, colored blue, red, yellow, and touched the old mans face. It seemed not to bother him.\n",
            "   “I wondered, free dirt? Never struck me youd have much left over. When you dig a hole and put the coffin in and refill the hole, you havent much dirt left, have you? I should think...”\n",
            "   The old man leaned forward. It was so unexpected that the stranger pulled his foot off the bottom step.\n",
            "   “You want some?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Why, no, no, I was just curious. Signs like that make you curious.”\n",
            "   “Set down,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Thanks.” The young man sat uneasily on the steps. “You know how it is, you walk around and never think how it is to own a graveyard.”\n",
            "   “And?” said the old man.\n",
            "   “I mean, like how much time it takes to dig graves.”\n",
            "   The old man leaned back in his chair. “On a cool day:\n",
            "   two hours. Hot day, four. Very hot day, six. Very cold day, not cold so it freezes, but real cold, a man can dig a grave in one hour so he can head in for hot chocolate, brandy in the chocolate. Then again, you get a good man on a hot day, hes no better than a bad man in the cold. Might take eight hours to open up, but heres easy-digging soil here. All loam, no rocks.”\n",
            "   “Im curious about winter.”\n",
            "   “In blizzards we got a icebox mausoleum to stash the dead, undelivered mail, until spring and a whole month of shovels and spades.”\n",
            "   “Seeding and planting time, eh?” The stranger laughed.\n",
            "   “You might say that.”\n",
            "   “Dont you dig in winter anyhow? For special funerals? Special dead?”\n",
            "   “Some yards got a hose-shovel contraption. Pump hot water through the blade; shape a grave quick, like placer mining, even with the ground an ice-pond. We dont cotton to that. Use picks and shovels.”\n",
            "   The young man hesitated. “Does it bother you?”\n",
            "   “You mean, I get scared ever?”\n",
            "   “Well... yes.”\n",
            "   The old man at last took out and stuffed his pipe with tobacco, tamped it with a callused thumb, lit it, let out a small stream of smoke.\n",
            "   “No,” he said at last.\n",
            "   The young mans shoulders sank. “Disappointed?” said the old man. “I thought maybe once .\n",
            "   “Oh, when youre young, maybe. One time... ”\n",
            "   “Then there was a time!” The young man shifted up a step. The old man glanced at him sharply, then resumed smoking. “One time.” He stared at the marbled hills and the dark trees. “My grandpa owned this yard. I was born here. A gravedigger” 5 son learns to ignore things.”\n",
            "   The old man took a number of deep puffs and said:\n",
            "   “I was just eighteen, folks off on vacation, me left to tend things, alone, mow the lawn, dig holes and such. Alone, four graves to dig in October and a cold came hard off the lake, frost on the graves, tombstones like snow, ground froze solid.\n",
            "   “One night I walked out. No moon. Hard grass underfoot, could see my breath, hands in my pockets, walking, listening.”\n",
            "   The old man exhaled frail ghosts from his thin nostrils. “Then I heard this sound, deep under. I froze. It was a voice, screaming. Someone woke up buried, heard me walk by, cried out. I just stood. They screamed and screamed. Earth banged. On a cold night, grounds like porcelain, rings, you see?\n",
            "   “Well—” The old man shut his eyes to remember. “I stood like the wind off the lake stopped my blood. A joke? I searched around and thought, Imagination! No, it was underfoot, sharp, clear. A womans voice. I knew all the gravestones.” The old mans eyelids trembled. “Could recite them alphabetical, year, month, day. Name any year, and Ill tell. How about 1899? Jake Smith departed. And 1923? Betty Dallman lost. And 1933? P. H. Moran! Name a month. August? August last year, buried Henrietta Wells. August 1918? Grandma Hanlon, whole family! Influenza! Name a day, August fourth? Smith, Burke, Shelby carried off. Williamson? Hes on that hill, pink marble. Douglas? By the creek... ”\n",
            "   “The story,” the young man urged.\n",
            "   “Eh?”\n",
            "   “The story you were telling.”\n",
            "   “Oh, the voice below? Well, I knew all the stones. Standing there, I guessed that voice out of the ground was Henrietta Fremwell, fine girl, twenty-four years, played piano at the Elite Theatre. Tall, graceful, blond. How did I know her voice? I stood where there was only mens graves. Hers was the only womans. I ran to put my ear on her stone. Yes! Her voice, way down, screaming!\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell!” I shouted.\n",
            "   “Miss Fremwell,” I yelled again.\n",
            "   “Deep down I heard her, only weeping now. Maybe she heard me, maybe not. She just cried. I ran downhill so fast I tripped and split my head on a stone, got up, screamed myself! Got to the tool shed, all blood, dragged out the tools, and just stood there in the moonlight with one shovel. The ground was ice solid, solid. I fell back against a tree. It would take three minutes to get back to her grave, and eight hours of cold night to dig to her box. The ground was like glass. A coffin is a coffin; only so much space for air. Henrietta Fremwell had been buried two days before the freeze, been asleep all that time, using up air, and it rained just before the cold spell and the earth over her, soaked with rainwater now, froze. Id have to dig maybe eight hours. And the way she cried, there wasnt another hour of air left.”\n",
            "   The old mans pipe had gone out. He rocked in his chair, back and forth, back and forth, silently.\n",
            "   “But,” said the young man, “what did you do?”\n",
            "   “Nothing,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Nothing!?”\n",
            "   “Nothing I could do. That ground was solid. Six men couldnt have dug that grave. No hot water near. And she mightve been screaming hours before I heard, so...\n",
            "   “You did-nothing?”\n",
            "   “Something Put the shovel and pick back in the tool shed, locked it and went back to the house and built a fire and drank some hot chocolate, shivering and shivering. Would you have done different?”\n",
            "   “I—”\n",
            "   “Would you have dug for eight hours in hard ice rock sos to reach her when she was truly dead of exhaustion, cold, smothered, and have to bury her all over again? Then call her folks and tell them?”\n",
            "   The young man was silent. On the porch, the mosquitoes hummed about the naked light bulb.\n",
            "   “I see,” said the young man.\n",
            "   The old man sucked his pipe. “I think I cried all night because there was nothing I could do.” He opened his eyes and stared about, surprised, as if he had been listening to someone else.\n",
            "   “Thats quite a story,” said the young man.\n",
            "   “No,” said the old man, “Gods truth. Want to hear more? See that big stone with the ugly angel? That was Adam Crispins. Relatives fought, got a writ from a judge, dug him up hoping for poison. Found nothing. Put him back, but by that time the dirt from his grave mixed with other dirts. We shoveled in stuff from all around. Next plot, the angel with broken wings? Mary-Lou Phipps. Dug her up to lug her off to Elgin, Illinois. More relatives. Where shed been, the pit stayed open, oh, three weeks. No funerals. Meanwhile, her dirt got cross-shoveled with others. Six stones over, one stone north, that was Henry Douglas Jones. Became famous sixty years after no one paid attention. Now hes planted under the Civil War monument. His grave lay wide two months, nobody wanted to utilize the hole of a Southerner, all of us leaning North with Grant. So his dirt got scattered. That give you some notion of what that FREE DIRT sign means?”\n",

            "   The old man pointed with his pipe and the stranger looked and indeed, by a nearby wall was a sizable hillock some ten feet long by about three feet high, loam and grass tufts of many shades of tan, brown, and burnt umber.\n",
            "   “Go look,” said the old man.\n",
            "   The young man walked slowly over to stand by the mound.\n",

            "   “What?” said the old man, looking somewhere else.\n",
            "   The stranger listened and shook his head. “Nothing.”\n",

            "   “I hadnt thought.”\n",
            "   “Yes, you have,” said the old man, “or you wouldnt have driven your lightweight delivery truck up by the cemetery gate. I got cats ears. Heard your motor just when you stopped. How much?”\n",
            "   “Oh,” said the young man uneasily. “My backyards eighty feet by forty. I could use a good inch of topsoil. So... ?”\n",
            "   “Id say,” said the old man, “half of that mound there. Hell, take it all. Nobody wants it.”\n",
            "   “You mean—”\n",
            "   “I mean, that mound has been growing and diminishing, diminishing and growing, mixtures up and down, since Grant took Richmond and Sherman reached the sea. Theres Civil dirt there, coffin splinters, satin casket shreds from when Lafayette met the Honor Guards Edgar Allan Poe. Theres funeral flowers, blossoms from ten hundred obsequies. Condolence-card confetti for Hessian troopers, Parisian gunners who never shipped home. That soil is so laced with bone meal and casket corsages, I should charge you to buy the lot. Grab a spade before I do.”\n",
            "   “Stay right there.” The young man raised one hand.\n",

            "   “Graveyard spades best. Familiar metal, familiar soil. Easy digging when like takes to like. So.”\n",
            "   The old mans head indicated a spade half stuck in the dark mound. The young man shrugged and moved.\n",
            "   The cemetery spade came free with a soft whispering. Pellets of ancient mound fell with similar whispers.\n",
            "   He began to dig and shift and fill the back of his half-truck as the old man from the corners of his eyes observed:\n",
            "   “Its more than dirt, as I said. War of 1812, San Juan Hill, Manassas, Gettysburg, October flu epidemic 1918, all strewn from graves filled and evicted to be refilled. Various occupants leavened out to dust, various glories melted to mixtures, rust from metal caskets, coffin handles, shoelaces but no shoes, hairs long and short. Ever see wreaths made of hair saved to weave crowns to fix on mortal pictures? All thats left of a smile or that funny look in the eyes of someone who knows shes not alive anymore, ever. Hair, epaulettes, not whole ones, but one strand of epaulette, all there along with blood thats gone to silt.”\n",
            "   The young man finished, sweating, and started to thrust the spade back in the earth when the old man said:\n",
            "   “Take it. Cemetery dirt, cemetery spade, like takes to like.”\n",
            "   “Ill bring it back tomorrow.” The young man tossed the spade into the mounded truck.\n",
            "   “No. You got the dirt, so keep the spade. Just dont bring the free dirt back.”\n",
            "   “Why would I do that?”\n",
            "   “Just dont,” said the old man, but did not move as the young man climbed in his truck to start the engine.\n",

Back on the horizon, thunder sounded. A few drops of rain fell on the windshield, causing the young man to ram his foot on the gas and swerve into his home street even as the sun truly died, the wind rose, and the trees around his cottage bent and beckoned.\n",
            "   Climbing out, he stared at the sky and then his house and then the empty garden. A few drops of cold rain on his cheeks decided him; he drove the rattling half-truck into the empty garden, unlatched the metal back-flap, opened it just an inch so as to allow a proper flow, and then began motoring back and forth across the garden, letting the dark stuffs whisper down, letting the strange midnight earth sift and murmur, until at last the truck was empty and he stood in the blowing night, watching the wind stir the black soil.\n",
            "   Then he locked the truck in the garage and went to stand on the back porch, thinking, I wont need water. The storm will soak the ground.\n",

            "   At midnight the rain grew heavy. He looked to see if it was eroding the new dark earth but saw only the black muck drinking the downpour like a great black sponge, lit by distant flares of lightning.\n",
            "   Then, at one in the morning, the greatest Niagara of all shuddered the house, rinsed the windows to blindness, and shook the lights.\n",
            "   And then, abruptly, the downpour, the immense Niagara ceased, followed by one great downfell blow of lightning which plowed and pinioned the dark earth close by, near, outside, with explosions of light as if ten thousand flashbulbs had been fired off. Then darkness fell in curtains of thunder, cracking, breaking the bones.\n",
            "   In bed, wishing for the merest dog to hold for lack of human company, hugging the sheets, burying his head, then rising full to the silent air, the dark air, the storm gone, the rain shut, and a silence that spread in whispers as the last drench melted into the trembling soil.\n",
            "   He shuddered and then shivered and then hugged himself to stop the shivering of his cold flesh, and he was thirsty but could not make himself move to find the kitchen and drink water, milk, leftover wine, anything. He lay back, dry-mouthed, with unreasonable tears filling his eyes.\n",
            "   Free dirt, he thought. My God, what a damn-fool night. Free dirt!\n",
            "   At two oclock he heard his wristwatch ticking softly.\n",

He was a genius verging on the brilliant, unmarried, unengaged, with no children that he could honestly claim, so having nothing much else to do, woke one morning in the summer of 1999, weeping.\n",
            "   “Why!?”\n",
            "   Out of bed, he faced his mirror to watch the tears, examine his sadness, trace the woe. Like a child, curious after emotion, he charted his own map, found no capital city of despair, but only a vast and empty expanse of sorrow, and went to shave.\n",
            "   Which didnt help, for Harrison Cooper had stumbled on some secret supply of melancholy that, even as he shaved, spilled in rivulets down his soaped cheeks.\n",
            "   “Great God,” he cried. “Im at a funeral, but whos dead?!”\n",
            "   He ate his breakfast toast somewhat soggier than usual and plunged off to his laboratory to see if gazing at his Time Traveler would solve the mystery of eyes that shed rain while the rest of him stood fair.\n",

            "   For Harrison Cooper had spent the better part of his third decade wiring circuitries of impossible pasts and as yet untouchable futures. Most men philosophize in their as-beautiful-as-women cars. Harrison Cooper chose to dream and knock together from pure air and electric thunderclaps what he called his Mobius Machine.\n",
            "   He had told his friends, with wine-colored nonchalance, that he was taking a future strip and a past strip, giving them a now half twist, so they looped on a single plane. Like those figure-eight ribbons, cut and pasted by that dear mathematician A. F. Mobius in the nineteenth century.\n",
            "   “Ah, yes, Mobius,” friends murmured.\n",
            "   What they really meant was, “Ah, no. Good night.”\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper was not a mad scientist, but he was irretrievably boring. Knowing this, he had retreated to finish the Mobius Machine. Now, this strange morning, with cold rain streaming from his eyes, he stood staring at the damned contraption, bewildered that he was not dancing about with Creations joy.\n",
            "   He was interrupted by the ringing of the laboratory doorbell and opened the door to find one of those rare people, a real Western Union delivery boy on a real bike. He signed for the telegram and was about to shut the door when he saw the lad staring fixedly at the Mobius Machine.\n",
            "   “What,” exclaimed the boy, eyes wide, “is that?”\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper stood aside and let the boy wander in a great circle around his Machine, his eyes dancing up, over, and around the immense circling figure eight of shining copper, brass, and silver.\n",
            "   “Sure!” cried the boy at last, beaming. “A Time Machine!”\n",
            "   “Bulls-eye!”\n",

            "   Suddenly he knew why he had wept at dawn. He grabbed the young lads hand. “Much thanks. Youre a catalyst—”\n",

            "   “Cut the cackle and move the buns,” said Samuel. “Did you call to sermonize or ask advice?”\n",

            "   As if fallen from a delivery-chute, the books arrived almost before the footfalls and then the half-seen feet and then the fog-wrapped legs and body and at last the head of a man who, as the ribbon spiraled itself back into emptiness, crouched over the volumes as if warming himself at a hearth.\n",
            "   He touched the books and listened to the air in the dim hallway where dinnertime voices drifted up from below and a door stood wide near his elbow, from which the faint scent of illness came and went, arrived and departed, with the stilted breathing of some patient within the room. Plates and silverware sounded from the world of evening and quiet good health downstairs. The hall and the sickroom were for a time deserted. In a moment, someone might ascend with a tray for the half-sleeping man in the intemperate room.\n",
            "   Harrison Cooper rose with stealth, checking the stairwell, and then, carrying a sweet burden of books, moved into the room, where candles lit both sides of a bed on which the dying man lay supine, arms straight at his sides, head weighting the pillow, eyes grimaced shut, mouth set as if daring the ceiling, mortality itself, to sink and extinguish him.\n",
            "   At the first touch of the books, now on one side, now on the other, of his bed, the old mans eyelids fluttered, his dry lips cracked; the air whistled from his nostrils:\n",
            "   “whos there?” he whispered. “what time is it?”\n",
            "   “whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, then I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can,” replied the traveler at the foot of the bed, quietly.\n",
            "   “what, what?” the old man in the bed whispered swiftly. “It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation,” quoted the visitor, who now moved to place a book under each of the dying mans hands where his tremoring fingers could scratch, pull away, then touch, Braille-like, again.\n",
            "   One by one, the stranger held up book after book, to show the covers, then a page, and yet another title page where printed dates of this novel surfed up, adrift, but to stay forever on some far future shore.\n",
            "   The sick mans eyes lingered over the covers, the tides, the dates, and then fixed to his visitors bright face. He exhaled, stunned. “My God, you have the look of a traveler. From where?”\n",
            "   “Do the years show?” Harrison Cooper leaned forward. “Well, then-I bring you an Annunciation.”\n",
            "   “Such things come to pass only with virgins,” whispered the old man. “No virgin lies here buried under his unread books.”\n",
            "   “I come to unbury you. I bring tidings from a far place.” The sick mans eyes moved to the books beneath his trembling hands.\n",
            "   “Mine?” he whispered.\n",
            "   The traveler nodded solemnly, but began to smile when the color in the old mans face grew warmer arid the expression in his eyes and on his mouth was suddenly eager.\n",
            "   “Is there hope. then?”\n",
            "   “There is!”\n",
            "   “I believe you.” The old man took a breath and then wondered, “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because,” said the stranger at the foot of the bed, “I love you.”\n",
            "   “I do not know you, sir!”\n",
            "   “But I know you fore and aft, port to starboard, main topgallants to gunnels, every day in your long life to here!”\n",
            "   “Oh, the sweet sound!” cried the old man. “Every word that you say, every light from your eyes, is foundation-of-the-world true! How can it be?” Tears winked from the old mans lids. “Why?”\n",
            "   “Because I am the truth,” said the traveler. “I have come a long way to find and say: you are not lost. Your great Beast has only drowned some little while. In another year, lost ahead, great and glorious, plain and simple men will gather at your grave and shout: he breeches, he rises, he breeches, he rises! and the white shape will surface to the light, the great terror lift into the storm and thunderous St. Elmos fire and you with him, each bound to each, and no way to tell where he stops and you start or where you stop and he goes off around the world lifting a fleet of libraries in his and your wake through nameless seas of sub-sub-librarians and readers mobbing the docks to chart your far journeyings, alert for your lost cries at three of a wild morn.”\n",
            "   “Christs wounds!” said the man in his winding-sheet bedclothes. “To the point, man, the point! Do you speak truth!?”\n",
            "   “I give you my hand on it, and pledge my soul and my hearts blood.” The visitor moved to do just this, and the two mens fists fused as one. “Take these gifts to the grave. Count these pages like a rosary in your last hours. Tell no one where they came from. Scoffers would knock the ritual beads from your fingers. So tell this rosary in the dark before dawn, and the rosary is this: you will live forever. You are immortal.”\n",
            "   “No more of this, no more! Be still.”\n",
            "   “I can not. Hear me. Where you have passed a fire path will burn, miraculous in the Bengal Bay, the Indian Seas, Hopes Cape, and around the Horn, past perditions landfall, as far as living eyes can see.”\n",
            "   He gripped the old mans fist ever more tightly.\n",
            "   “I swear. In the years ahead, a million millions will crowd your grave to sleep you well and warm your bones. Do you hear?”\n",
            "   “Great God, you are a proper priest to sound my Last Rites. And will I enjoy my own funeral? I will.”\n",
            "   His hands, freed, clung to the books at each side, as the ardent visitor raised yet other books and intoned the dates:\n",
            "   “Nineteen twenty-two... 1930... 1935... 1940 . 1955... 1970. Can you read and know what it means?”\n",
            "   He held the last volume close to the old mans face. The fiery eyes moved. The old mouth creaked.\n",
            "   “Nineteen ninety?”\n",
            "   “Yours. One hundred years from tonight.”\n",
            "   “Dear God!”\n",
            "   “I must go, but I would hear. Chapter One. Speak.”\n",
            "   The old mans eyes slid and burned. He licked his lips, traced the words, and at last whispered, beginning to weep:\n",
            "   “Call me Ishmael.”\n",
            "   \n",
            "   There was snow and more snow and more snow after that. In the dissolving whiteness, the silver ribbon twirled in a massive whisper to let forth in an exhalation of Time the journeying librarian and his book bag. As if slicing white bread rinsed by snow, the ribbon, as the traveler ghosted himself to flesh, sifted him through the hospital wall into a room as white as December. There, abandoned, lay a man as pale as the snow and the wind. Almost young, he slept with his mustaches oiled to his lip by fever. He seemed not to know nor care that a messenger had invaded the air near his bed. His eyes did not stir, nor did his mouth increase the passage of breath. His hands at his sides did not open to receive. He seemed already lost in a bomb and only his unexpected visitors voice caused his eyes to roll behind their shut lids.\n",

            "   In Paris, an hour, a day, a year, a minute later, there was a run of St. Elmos fire along a church steeple, a blue glow in a dark alley, a soft tread at a street corner, a turnabout of wind like an invisible carousel, and then footfalls up a stair to a door which opened on a bedroom where a window looked out upon cafes filled with people and far music, and in a bed by the window, a tall man lying, his pale face immobile, until he heard alien breath in his room.\n",
            "   The shadow of a man stood over him and now leaned down so that the light from the window revealed a face and a mouth as it inhaled and then spoke. The single word that the mouth said was:\n",

            "   \n",
            "   They drove into green Sunday-morning country, away from the hot aluminum city, and watched as the sky was set free and moved over them like a lake they had never known was there, amazingly blue and with white breakers above them as they traveled.\n",
            "   Clarence Travers slowed the car and felt the cool wind move over his face with the smell of cut grass. He reached over to grasp his wifes hand and glanced at his son and daughter in the backseat, not fighting, at least for this moment, as the car moved through one quiet beauty after another in what might be a Sunday so lush and green it would never end.\n",
            "   “Thank God were doing this,” said Cecelia Travers. “Its been a million years since we got away.” He felt her hand hug his and then relax completely. “when I think of all those ladies dropping dead from the heat at the cocktail parry this afternoon, welt”\n",
            "   “Well, indeed,” said Clarence Travers. “Onward!”\n",
            "   He pressed the gas pedal and they moved faster. Their progress out of the city had been mildly hysterical, with cars shrieking and shoving them toward islands of wilderness praying for picnics that might not be found. Seeing that he had put the car in the fast lane, he slowed to gradually move himself and his family through the banshee traffic until they were idling along at an almost reasonable fifty miles an hour. The scents of flowers and trees that blew in the window made his move worthwhile. He laughed at nothing at all and said:\n",
            "   “Sometimes, when I get this far out, I think lets just keep driving, never go back to the damned city.”\n",
            "   “Lets drive a hundred miles,” shouted his son.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” cried his daughter.\n",
            "   “A thousand!” said Clarence Travers. “But one slow mile at a time.” And then said, softly, “Hey!”\n",
            "   And as suddenly as if they had dreamed it up, the lost highway came into view. “Wonderful!” said Mr. Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “What?” asked the children.\n",
            "   “Look!” said Clarence Travers, leaning over his wife, pointing. “Thats the Old road. The one they used a long time ago.”\n",
            "   “That?” said his wife.\n",
            "   “Its awfully small,” said his son.\n",
            "   “Well, there werent many cars then, they didnt need much.”\n",
            "   “It looks like a big snake,” said his daughter.\n",
            "   “Yeah, the old roads used to twist and turn, all right. Remember?”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers nodded. The car had slowed and they gazed over at that narrow concrete strip with the green grass buckling it gently here or there and sprays of wildflowers nestling up close to either side and the morning sunlight coming down through the high elms and maples and oaks that led the way toward the forest.\n",
            "   “I know it like the nose on my face,” said Clarence Travers. “How would you like to ride on it?”\n",
            "   “Oh, Clarence, now\n",
            "   “I mean it.”\n",
            "   “Oh, Daddy, could we?”\n",
            "   “All right, well do it,” he said decisively.\n",
            "   “We cant!” said Cecelia Travers. “Its probably against the law. It cant be safe.”\n",
            "   But before his wife could finish, he turned off the freeway and let all the swift cars rush on while he drove, smiling at each bump, down over a small ditch, toward the old road.\n",
            "   “Clarence, please! well be arrested!”\n",
            "   “For going ten miles an hour on a highway nobody uses anymore? Lets not kick over any beehives, its too nice a day. Ill buy you all soda pops if you behave.”\n",
            "   They reached the old road.\n",
            "   “See how simple? Now which way, kids?”\n",
            "   “That way, that way!”\n",
            "   “Easy as pie!”\n",
            "   And he let the car take them away on the old highway, the great white-gray boa constrictor that lashed now slowly this way in green moss-velvet meadows, looped over gentle hills, and lowered itself majestically into caves of moist-smelling trees, through the odor of cricks and spring mud and crystal water that rustled like sheets of cellophane over small stone falls. They drove slow enough to see the waterspiders” enigmatic etchings on quiet pools behind dams of last Octobers leaves.\n",
            "   “Daddy, what are those?”\n",
            "   “What, the water-skaters? No one has ever caught one. You wait and wait and put your hand out and bang! The spiders gone. Theyre the first things in life you cant grab onto. The list gets bigger as you grow old, so start small. Dont believe in them. Theyre not really there.”\n",
            "   “Its fun thinking they are.”\n",
            "   “You have just stated a deep philosophical truth. Now, drive on, Mr. Travers.” And obeying his own command with good humor, he drove on.\n",
            "   And they came to a forest that had been like November all through the winter and now, reluctantly, was putting out green flags to welcome the season. Butterflies in great tosses of confetti leaped from the deeps of the forest to ramble drunkenly on the air, their thousand torn shadows following over grass and water.\n",
            "   “Lets go back now,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Aw, Mom,” said the son and daughter.\n",
            "   “Why?” said Clarence Travers. “My God, how many kids back in that damned hot town can say they drove on a road nobody else has used in years? Not one! Not one with a father brave enough to cross a little grass to take the old way. Right?”\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers lapsed into silence.\n",
            "   “Right there,” said Clarence Travers, “over that hill, the highway turns left, then right, then left again, an S curve, and another S. Wait and see.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “Right.”\n",
            "   “Left.”\n",
            "   “An S curve.”\n",
            "   The car purred.\n",
            "   “Another S!”\n",
            "   “Just like you said!”\n",
            "   “Look.” Clarence Travers pointed. A hundred yards across the way from them, the freeway suddenly appeared for a few yards before it vanished, screaming behind stacks of playing-card billboards. Clarence Travers stared fixedly at it and the grass between it and this shadowed path, this silent place like the bottom of an old stream where tides used to come but came no more, where the wind ran through nights making the old sound of far traffic.\n",
            "   “You know something,” said the wife. “That freeway over there scares me.”\n",
            "   “Can we drive home on this old road instead, Dad?” said the son.\n",
            "   “I wish we could.”\n",
            "   “Ive always been scared,” said the wife, watching that other traffic roaring by, gone before it arrived.\n",
            "   “Were all afraid,” said Clarence Travers. “But you pay your money and take your chance. Well?”\n",
            "   His wife sighed. “Damn, get back on that dreadful thing.”\n",
            "   “Not quite yet,” said Clarence Travers and drove to reach a small, very small village, all quite unexpected, a settlement no more than a dozen white clapboard houses mossed under giant trees, dreaming in a green tide of water and leaf-shadow, with wind shaking the rocking chairs on weathered porches and dogs sleeping in the cool nap of grass-carpeting at noon, and a small general store with a dirty red gas pump out front.\n",
            "   They drew up there and got out and stood, unreal in the sudden lack of motion, not quite accepting these houses lost in the wilderness.\n",
            "   The door to the general store squealed open and an old man stepped out, blinked at them, and said, “Say, did you folks just come down that old road?”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers avoided his wifes accusing eyes. “Yes, sir.\n",
            "   “No one on that road in twenty years.”\n",
            "   “We were out for a lark,” said Mr. Travers. “And found a peacock,” he added.\n",
            "   “A sparrow,” said his wife.\n",
            "   “The freeway passed us by, a mile over there, if you want it,” said the old man. “When the new road opened, this town just died on the vine. We got nothing here now but people like me. That is: old.”\n",
            "   “Looks like thered be places here to rent.”\n",
            "   “Mister, just walk in, knock out the bats, stomp the spiders, and any place is yours for thirty bucks a month. I own the whole town.”\n",
            "   “Oh, were not really interested,” said Cecelia Travers.\n",
            "   “Didnt think you would be,” said the old man. “Too far out from the city, too far off the freeway. And that dirt road there slops over when it rains, all muck and mud. And, heck, its against the law to use that path. Not that they ever patrol it.” The old man snorted, shaking his head. “And not that Ill turn you in. But it gave me a nice start just now to see you coming down that rut. J had to give a quick look at my calendar, by God, and make sure it wasnt 1929!”\n",
            "   Lord, I remember, thought Clarence Travers. This is Fox Hill. A thousand people lived here. I was a kid, we passed through on summer nights. We used to stop here late late, and me sleeping in the backseat in the moonlight. My grandmother and grandfather in back with me. Its nice to sleep in a car driving late and the road all white, watching the stars turn as you take the curves, listening to the grown-ups” voices underwater, remote, talking, talking, laughing, murmuring, whispering. My father driving, so stolid. Just to be driving in the summer dark, up along the lake to the Dunes, where the poison ivy grew out on the lonely beach and the wind stayed all the time and never went away. And us driving by that lonely graveyard place of sand and moonlight and poison ivy and the waves tumbling in like dusty ash on the shore, the lake pounding like a locomotive on the sand, coming and going. And me crumpled down and smelling Grandmothers wind-cooled coat and the voices comforting and blanketing me with their solidity and their always-will-be-here sounds that would go on forever, myself always young and us always riding on a summer night in our old Kissel with the side flaps down. And stopping here at nine or ten for Pistachio and Tutti-frutti ice cream that tasted, faintly, beautifully, of gasoline. All of us licking and biting the cones and smelling the gasoline and driving on, sleepy and snug, toward home, Green Town, thirty years ago.\n",
            "   He caught himself and said:\n",
            "   “About these houses, would it be much trouble fixing them up?” He squinted at the old man.\n",
            "   “Well, yes and no, most of “em over fifty years old, lots of dust. You could buy one off me for ten thousand, a real bargain now, youll admit. If you were an artist, now, a painter, or something like that.”\n",
            "   “I write copy in an advertising firm.”\n",
            "   “Write stories, too, no doubt? Well, now, you get a writer out here, quiet, no neighbors, youd do lots of writing.”\n",
            "   Cecelia Travers stood silently between the old man and her husband. Clarence Travers did not look at her, but looked at the cinders around the porch of the general store. “I imagine I could work here.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Ive often thought,” said Mr. Travers, “its time we got away from the city and took it a little easy.”\n",
            "   “Sure,” said the old man.\n",
            "   Mrs. Travers said nothing but searched in her purse and took out a minor.\n",
            "   “Would you like some drinks?” asked Clarence Travers with exaggerated concern. “Three Orange Crushes, make it four,” he told the old man. The old man moved inside the store, which smelled of nails and crackers and dust.\n",
            "   When the old man was gone, Mr. Travers turned to his wife, and his eyes were shining. “Weve always wanted to do it! Lets!”\n",
            "   “Do what?” she said.\n",
            "   “Move out here, snap decision, why not? Why? Weve promised ourselves every year: get away from the noise, the confusion, so the kidsd have a place to play. And...\n",
            "   “Good grief” the wife cried.\n",
            "   The old man moved inside the store, coughing. “Ridiculous.” She lowered her voice. “Weve got the apartment paid up, youve got a fine job, the kids have school with friends, I belong to some fine clubs. And weve just spent a bundle redecorating. We—”\n",
            "   “Listen,” he said, as if she were really listening. “None of thats important. Out here, we can breathe. Back in town, hell, you complain... ”\n",
            "   “Just to have something to complain about.”\n",
            "   “Your clubs cant be that important.”\n",
            "   “Its not clubs, its friends!”\n",
            "   “How many would care if we dropped dead tomorrow?” he said. “If I got hit in that traffic, how many thousand cars would run over me before one stopped to see if I was a man or dog left in the road?”\n",
            "   “Your job...” she started to say.\n",
            "   “My God, ten years ago we said, in two more years well have enough money to quit and write my novel! But each year weve said  year! and  year and  year!”\n",
            "   “Weve had fun, havent we?”\n",
            "   “Sure! Subways are fun, buses are fun, martinis and drunken friends are fun. Advertising? Yeah! But Ive used all the fun there is! I want to write about what Ive seen now, and theres no better place than this. Look at that house over there! Cant you just see me in the front window banging the hell out of my typewriter?”\n",
            "   “Stop hyperventilating!”\n",
            "   “Hyperventilate? God, Id jump for joy to quit. Ive gone as far as I can go. Come on, Cecelia, lets get back some of the spunk in our marriage, take a chance!”\n",
            "   “The children\n",
            "   “Wed love it here!” said the son.\n",
            "   “I think,” said the daughter.\n",
            "   “Im not getting any younger,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   “Nor am I,” she said, touching his arm. “But we cant play hopscotch now. When the children leave, yes, well think about it.”\n",
            "   “Children, hopscotch, my God, Ill take my typewriter to the grave!”\n",
            "   “It wont be long. We—”\n",
            "   The shop door squealed open again and whether the old man had been standing in the screen shadow for the last minute, there was no telling. It did not show in his face. He stepped out with four lukewarm bottles of Orange Crush in his rust-spotted hands.\n",
            "   “Here you are,” he said.\n",
            "   Clarence and Cecelia Travers turned to stare at him as if he were a stranger come out to bring them drinks. They smiled and took the bottles.\n",
            "   The four of them stood drinking the soda pop in the warm sunlight. The summer wind blew through the grottoes of trees in the old, shady town. It was like being in a great green church, a cathedral, the trees so high that the people and cottages were lost far down below. All night long you would imagine those trees rustling Their leaves like an ocean on an unending shore. God, thought Clarence Travers, you could really sleep here, the sleep of the dead and the peace-fill-of-heart.\n",
            "   He finished his drink and his wife half finished hers and gave it to the children to argue over, inch by compared inch. The old man stood silent, embarrassed by the thing he may have stirred up among them.\n",
            "   “Well, if youre ever out this way, drop in,” he said. Clarence Travers reached for his wallet.\n",
            "   “No, no!” said the old man. “Its on the house.”\n",
            "   “Thank you, thank you very much.”\n",
            "   “A pleasure.”\n",
            "   They climbed back into their car.\n",
            "   “If you want to get to the freeway,” said the old man, peering through the front window into the cooked-upholstery smell of the car, “just take your old dirt road back. Dont rush, or youll break an axle.”\n",
            "   Clarence Travers looked straight ahead at the radiator fixture on the car front and started the motor.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” said the old man.\n",
            "   “Good-bye,” the children yelled, and waved. The car moved away through the town.\n",
            "   “Did you hear what the old man said?” asked the wife.\n",
            "   “What?”\n",
            "   “Did you hear him say which way to the freeway?”\n",
            "   “I heard.”\n",
            "   He drove through the cool, shady town, staring at the porches and the windows with the colored glass fringing them. If you looked from the inside of those windows out, people had different-colored faces for each pane you looked through. They were Chinese if you looked through one, Indian through another, pink, green, violet, burgundy, wine, chartreuse, the candy colors, the lemon-lime cool colors, the water colors of the windows looking out on lawns and trees and this car slowly driving past.\n",
            "   “Yes, I heard him,” said Clarence Travers.\n",
            "   They left the town behind and took the dirt road to the freeway. They waited their chance, saw an interval between floods of cars hurtling by, swerved out into the stream, and, at fifty miles an hour, were soon hurtling toward the city.\n",
            "   “Thats better,” said Cecelia Travers brightly. She did not look over at her husband. “Now I know where we are.”\n",
            "   Billboards flashed by; a mortuary, a pie crust, a cereal, a garage, a hotel. A hotel in the tar pits of the city, where one day is the pitiless glare of the noon sun, thought Mr. Travers, all of the great Erector-set buildings, like prehistoric dinosaurs, will sink down into the bubbling tar-lava and be encased, bone by bone, for future civilizations. And in the stomachs of the electric lizards, inside the iron dinosaurs, the probing scientists of A. D. One Million will find the little ivory bones, the thinly articulated skeletons of advertising executives and clubwomen and children. Mr. Travers felt his eyes flinch, watering. And the scientists will say, so this is what the iron cities fed on, is it? and give the bones a kick. So this is what kept the iron stomachs full, eh? Poor things, they never had a chance. Probably kept by the iron monsters who needed them in order to survive, who needed them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Aphids, in a way, aphids, kept in a great metal cage.\n",
            "   “Look, Daddy, look, look, before its too late!”\n",

            "   \n",
            "   The old highway, two hundred yards away, at their left, sprang back into sight for an instant, wandered aimlessly through field, meadow, and stream, gentle and cool and quiet.\n",
            "   Mr. Travers swung his head sharply to see, but in that instant it was gone. Billboards, trees, hills rushed it away. A thousand cars, honking, shrieking, shouldered them, and bore Clarence and Cecelia Travers and their captive children stunned and silent down the concourse, onward ever onward into a city that had not seen them leave and did not look to see them return\n",

            "   When I was eight years old, in 1928, an incredible event occurred on the back wall outside the Academy motion picture theater in Waukegan, Illinois. An advertising broadside, some thirty feet long and twenty feet high, dramatized Black-stone the Magician in half a dozen miraculous poses: sawing a lady in half; tied to an Arabian cannon that exploded, taking him with it; dancing a live handkerchief in midair; causing a birdcage with a live canary to vanish between his fingers; causing an elephant to... well, you get the idea. I must have stood there for hours, frozen with awe. I knew then that someday I must become a magician.\n",
            "   Thats what happened, didnt it? Im not a science fiction, fantasy, magic-realism writer of fairy tales and surrealist poems. Quicker Than the Eye may well be the best title I have ever conjured for a new collection. I pretend to do one thing, cause you to blink, and in the instant seize twenty bright silks out of a bottomless hat.\n",
            "   How does he do that? may well be asked. I really cant say. I dont write these stories, they write me. Which causes me to live with a boundless enthusiasm for writing and life that some misinterpret as optimism.\n",
            "   Nonsense. I am merely a practitioner of optimal behavior, which means behave yourself; listen to your Muses, get your work done, and enjoy the sense that you just might live forever.\n",
            "   I dont have to wait for inspiration. It jolts me every morning. Just before dawn, when I would prefer to sleep in, the damned stuff speaks between my ears with my Theater of Morning voices. Yes, yes, I know, that sounds awfully artsy, and no, no, I am not preaching some sort of Psychic Summons. The voices exist because I stashed them there every day for a lifetime by reading, writing, and living. They accumulated and began to speak soon after high school.\n",
            "   In other words, I do not greet each day with a glad cry but am forced out of bed by these whispering nags, drag myself to the typewriter, and am soon awake and alive as the notion/fancy/concept quits my ears, runs down my elbows and out my fingers. Two hours later, a new story is done that, all night, hid asleep behind my medulla oblongata.\n",
            "   That, dont you agree, is not optimism. Its behavior. Optimal.\n",
            "   I dare not oppose these morning voices. If I did, they would ransack my conscience all day. Besides, I am as out of control as a car off a cliff. What began as a numbed frenzy before breakfast, ends with elation at noon lunch.\n",
            "   How did I find these metaphors? Let me count the ways:\n",
            "   You discover your wife is pregnant with your first child soon to be born, so you name the embryonic presence “Sascha” and converse with this increasingly bright fetus that evolves into a story that you love but no one wants. So here it is.\n",
            "   You wonder whatever happened to Dorian Grays portrait. Your second thoughts grow to an outsize horror by nightfall. You upchuck this hairball into your typewriter.\n",
            "   Some of these stories “happened” to me. “Quicker Than the Eye” was part of a magic show I attended where, with dismay, I saw someone much like myself being made a fool of onstage.\n",
            "   “No News, or What Killed the Dog?” was a Victrola record I played all day every day when I was five, until the neighbors offered to break me or the record, choose.\n",
            "   “That Woman on the Lawn” was first a poem that then turned into a story about my mother as a young and needful woman; a topic we care to discuss only with euphemisms.\n",
            "   “Another Fine Mess” resulted from my writing “The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair.” There had to be a sequel, because when I arrived in Ireland forty years ago, the Irish Times announced LAUREL AND HARDY, ONE TIME ONLY, IN PERSON! FOR THE IRISH ORPHANS. OLYMPIA THEATER, DUBLIN. I rushed to the theater and bought the last ticket, front row center!\n",
            "   The curtain rose and there they were, Stan and Ollie, doing all their old, sweet, wondrous routines. I sat with happy tears streaming down my face. Later I went backstage and stood by their dressing room door watching them greet friends. I didnt introduce myself. I just wanted to warm my hands and heart. After twenty minutes of ambience bathing, I slipped away. Thus “Another Fine Mess.”\n",
            "   “Unterderseaboat Doktor” is an example of people not hearing themselves talk. A writer friend at lunch some years back described his psychiatrist, a former submarine captain in Hitlers undersea fleet. “Holy God,” I cried, “give me a pencil!” I scribbled a title and finished the tale that night. My writer friend hated me for weeks.\n",
            "   “Last Rites” wrote itself because I am the greatest lover of other writers, old or new, who ever lived. I have never been jealous of any writer, I only wanted to write and dream like them. That makes for an enormous list, some of them first-class ladies as well as writers first class: Willa Cather, Jessamyn West, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Weelty, and, long before her current fame, Edith Wharton. “Last Rites” shuttles in Time to pay my respects to three of my heroes, Poe, Melville, and a third writer, nameless until the finale. It crazed me to perceive that these giants died thinking they were to be buried unknown and unread. I had to invent a Time Machine to celebrate them on their deathbeds.\n",
            "   Some of the stories are self-evident. “At the End of the Ninth Year” is the sort of quasi-scientific factoid we all discuss a dozen times, but neglect to write.\n",
            "   “The Other Highway” lies beside the main route heading north from Los Angeles. It has all but vanished under grass, bushes, trees, and avalanched soil. Here and there you can still bike it for some few hundred yards before it melts into the earth.\n",
            "   “Once More, Legato” spontaneously combusted one afternoon when I heard a treeful of birds orchestrating Berlioz and then Albeniz.\n",
            "   If you know the history of Paris during the 1870s” Commune and Haussmann, who tore it down and built it back to the wonder it is now, and if you have experienced some Los Angeles earthquakes, you” could guess the genesis of “Zaharoff/Richter Mark V.” During the last High Shake, two years ago, I thought: My God, the damn fools built the city on the San Andreas Fault! My  thought: what if they built it that way on purpose?!\n",
            "   Two hours later, the story was cooling on the windowsill.\n",
            "   Thats not all, but it should do.\n",
            "   My final advice to myself; the boy magician grown old, and you?\n",
            "   When your dawn theater sounds to clear your sinuses:\n",
            "   dont delay. Jump. Those voices may be gone before you hit the shower to align your wits.\n",
            "   Speed is everything. The 90-mph dash to your machine is a sure cure for life rampant and death most real.\n",
            "   Make haste to live.\n",
            "   Oh, God, yes.\n",
            "   Live. And write. With great haste.\n",
